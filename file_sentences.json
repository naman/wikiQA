        "the young pascal showed an amazing aptitude for mathematics and science",

        "like the bridge the sound post is not glued but is kept in place by the tensions of the bridge and strings", 
        "together the bass bar and sound post transfer the strings vibrations to the top front of the instrument and to a lesser extent the back acting as a diaphragm to produce the instrument s sound", 
        "cellos are constructed and repaired using hide glue which is strong but reversible allowing for disassembly when needed", 
        "tops may be glued on with diluted glue since some repairs call for the removal of the top",

        "both come from the same species of tree caesalpina echinata but pernambuco used for higher quality bows is the heartwood of the tree and is darker in color than brazilwood which is sometimes stained to compensate", 
        "pernambuco is a heavy resinous wood with great elasticity which makes it an ideal wood for instrument bows", 
        "bows are also made from other materials such as carbon fiber stronger than wood and fiberglass often used to make inexpensive low quality student bows", 
        "an average cello bow is 73 cm long shorter than a violin or viola bow 3 cm high from the frog to the stick and 1 5 cm wide", 
        "the frog of a cello bow typically has a rounded corner like that of a viola bow but is wider", 
        "a cello bow is roughly 10 grams heavier than a viola bow which in turn is roughly 10 grams heavier than a violin bow", 
        "bow hair is traditionally horsehair though synthetic hair in varying colors is also used", 
        "prior to playing a musician in this case a cellist tightens the bow by turning a screw to pull the frog the part of the bow under the hand back and increase the tension of the hair", 
        "rosin is applied by the player to make the hairs sticky", 
        "bows need to be re haired periodically", 
        "ideally a bow should be re haired every year but this is not in great practice because of cost", 
        "the cello developed from the bass violin first referred to by jambe de fer in 1556 which was originally a three string instrument", 
        "the first instance of a composer specifying the bass violin may have been gabrieli in sacrae symphoniae 1597", 
        "monteverdi referred to the instrument as basso de viola da braccio in orfeo 1607", 
        "although the first bass violin possibly invented by amati as early as 1538 was most likely inspired by the viol it was created to be used in consorts with the violin", 
        "the bass violin was actually often referred to as a violone or large viola as were the viols of the same period", 
        "instruments that share features with both the bass violin and the viola de gamba appear in italian art of the early 1500s the invention of wire wound strings fine wire around a thin gut core around 1660 in bologna allowed for a finer bass sound than was possible with purely gut strings on such a short body", 
        "bolognese makers exploited this new technology to create the cello a somewhat smaller instrument suitable for solo repertoire due to both the timbre of the instrument and the fact that the smaller size made it easier to play virtuosic passages", 
        "this instrument had disadvantages as well however", 
        "the cello s light sound was not as suitable for church and ensemble playing so it had to be doubled by basses or violones", 
        "around 1700 italian players popularized the cello in northern europe although the bass violin basse de violon continued to be used for another two decades in france many existing bass violins were literally cut down in size in order to convert them into cellos according to the smaller pattern cello as developed by stradivari who also made a number of old pattern large cello s the servais", 
        "cyr 1982 the bass violin remained the most used instrument in england as late as 1740 where the violoncello was still not common", 
        "grassineau 1740 the sizes names and tunings of the cello varied widely by geography and time", 
        "the size was not standardized until around 1750", 
        "despite similarities to the viola da gamba the cello is actually part of the viola da braccio family meaning viol of the arm which includes among others the violin and viola", 
        "though paintings like bruegel s the rustic wedding and de fer in his epitome musical suggest that the bass violin had alternate playing positions these were short lived and the more practical and ergonomic a gamba position eventually replaced them entirely", 
        "a cello strung with gut strings", 
        "note the absence of fine tuning pins on the tailpiece", 
        "baroque era cellos differed from the modern instrument in several ways", 
        "the neck has a different form and angle which matches the baroque bass bar and stringing", 
        "modern cellos have an endpin at the bottom to support the instrument and transmit some of the sound through the floor while baroque cellos are held only by the calves of the player", 
        "modern bows curve in and are held at the frog; baroque bows curve out and are held closer to the bow s point of balance", 
        "modern strings normally have a metal core although some use a synthetic core; baroque strings are made of gut with the g and c strings wire wound", 
        "modern cellos often have fine tuners connecting the strings to the tailpiece which make it much easier to tune the instrument but such pins are rendered ineffective by the flexibility of the gut strings used on baroque cellos", 
        "overall the modern instrument has much higher string tension than the baroque cello resulting in a louder more projecting tone with fewer overtones", 
        "no educational works specifically devoted to the cello existed before the 18th century and those that do exist contain little value to the performer beyond simple accounts of instrumental technique", 
        "the earliest cello manual is michel corrette s methode theorique et pratique pour apprendre en peu de temps le violoncelle dans sa perfection paris 1741", 
        "seated cellist the cello is usually played while seated", 
        "its weight is supported mainly by its endpin or spike which rests on the floor", 
        "sometimes an endpin support is needed to prevent the endpin from slipping on smooth surfaces", 
        "the cello is steadied on the lower bout between the knees of the seated player and on the upper bout against the upper chest", 
        "the neck of the cello is above the player s left shoulder and the c string tuning peg is just behind the left ear", 
        "the bow is drawn horizontally across the strings", 
        "in early times female cellists sometimes played side saddle since it was considered improper for a lady to part her knees in public", 
        "a player s handedness does not alter the way the cello is held or used", 
        "in exceedingly rare cases the cello has been played in a mirror image posture this is usually because of a physical disability of one of the player s arms or hands which makes the required technique impossible for that side of the body", 
        "in such a situation the player must decide whether or not to reverse the set up of the cello the string positions bass bar sound post fingerboard shape and bridge carving are all asymmetrical", 
        "the position of the left hand fingers along the strings determine the pitch of the note", 
        "the closer to the bridge that the string is depressed the higher in pitch will be the resulting sound because the vibrating string length has been shortened", 
        "in the neck positions which use just less than half of the fingerboard nearest the top of the instrument the thumb rests on the back of the neck; in thumb position a general name for notes on the remainder of the fingerboard the thumb usually rests alongside the fingers on the string and the side of the thumb is used to play notes", 
        "the fingers are normally held curved with each knuckle bent with the fingertips in contact with the string", 
        "if a finger is required on two or more strings at once to play perfect fifths in double stops or chords it is used flat", 
        "in slower or more expressive playing the contact point can move slightly away from the nail to the pad of the finger allowing a fuller vibrato", 
        "vibrato is a small oscillation in the pitch of a note usually considered expressive", 
        "it is created by a partial rotation of the upper arm at the shoulder joint which translates into a linear oscillation of the lower arm", 
        "the fixed point of contact of the fingertip on the string absorbs this motion by rocking back and forth", 
        "it is this change in the attitude of the fingertip to the string which causes the pitch to vary", 
        "vibrato is a key expressive device and a well developed vibrato technique is an essential element of a modern cellist s skill", 
        "in some styles of music such as that of the romantic period vibrato may be used on almost every note", 
        "however in other styles such as baroque repertoire vibrato is used only rarely as an ornament", 
        "in any case the choice of whether to use vibrato and how much is normally a stylistic decision on the part of the player", 
        "typically the lower the pitch of the note played the wider and slower the vibrato", 
        "harmonics played on the cello fall into two classes; natural and artificial", 
        "natural harmonics are produced by lightly touching but not depressing the string with the finger at certain places and then bowing or rarely plucking the string", 
        "for example the halfway point of the string will produce a harmonic that is one octave above the unfingered open string", 
        "natural harmonics only produce notes that are part of the harmonic series for the string on which they occur", 
        "artificial harmonics also called false harmonics in which the player depresses the string fully with one finger while touching the same string lightly with another finger can produce any notes above middle c they usually appear with the touching note a perfect fourth above the stopped note which produces a sound two octaves above the stopped note although other intervals are available", 
        "all harmonics produce a distinctive flute like sound and are usually performed without vibrato", 
        "glissando sliding in italian is an effect played by sliding the finger up or down the fingerboard without releasing the string", 
        "this causes the pitch to rise and fall smoothly without separate discernible steps", 
        "in cello playing the bow is much like the breath of a wind instrument player", 
        "arguably it is the major determinant in the expressiveness of the playing", 
        "the right hand holds the bow and controls the duration and character of the notes", 
        "the bow is drawn across the strings roughly halfway between the end of the fingerboard and the bridge in a direction perpendicular to the strings", 
        "the bow is held with all five fingers of the right hand the thumb opposite the fingers and closer to the cellist s body", 
        "the shape of the hand should resemble that of its relaxed state with all fingers curved including the thumb", 
        "the transmission of weight from the arm to the bow happens through the pronation inward rotation of the forearm which pushes the index finger and to a lesser degree the middle finger onto the bow", 
        "the necessary counterforce is provided by the thumb", 
        "depending upon the school of training the other two fingers are used in various degrees to help maintain the angle of the bow to the string and are critical to controlling the bow when it is off the string", 
        "see also spiccato", 
        "in english the terminology for bow direction down and up can be misleading", 
        "a downbow is drawn to the right of the player and an upbow to the left", 
        "a downbow is drawn by first using the upper arm then the forearm then the wrist turning slightly inward in order to maintain a straight stroke", 
        "an upbow is drawn by moving first the forearm then the upper arm then the wrist pushing slightly upward", 
        "the bow is mostly used perpendicular to the string being played", 
        "in order to perform string changes the whole arm is either lowered or lifted with as little wrist movement as possible in order to maintain the angle to the string", 
        "however flexibility of the wrist is necessary when changing the bow direction from up bow to down bow and vice versa", 
        "for very fast bow movements the wrist is used to accomplish the horizontal movement of bow", 
        "for longer strokes the arm is used as well as the wrist", 
        "tone production and volume of sound depend on a combination of several factors", 
        "the three most important ones are bow speed weight applied to the string and point of contact of the bow hair with the string", 
        "a good player will be capable of a very even tone and will counter the natural tendency to play with the most force with the part of the bow nearest to the frog or heel and the least force near the tip", 
        "the closer to the bridge the string is bowed the more projecting and brighter the tone with the extreme sul ponticello producing a metallic shimmery sound", 
        "if bowing closer to the fingerboard sul tasto the sound produced will be softer more mellow and less defined", 
        "double stops involve the playing of two notes at the same time", 
        "two strings are fingered simultaneously and the bow is drawn so as to sound them both at once", 
        "triple and quadruple stops may also be played in a broken fashion but are difficult to sustain because of the change in slope of the bridge", 
        "to extend the technique in this area frances marie uitti has invented a two bow system one bow plays above the strings and one below allowing for sustained triple and quadruple stops", 
        "however this technique is very rarely seen or used", 
        "in pizzicato playing the string is plucked directly with the fingers or thumb", 
        "usually this is done with the right hand while the bow is held away from the strings by the rest of the hand or for extended passages set down", 
        "a single string can be played pizzicato or double triple or quadruple stops can be played", 
        "occasionally a player must bow one string with the right hand and simultaneously pluck another with the left", 
        "this is marked by a above the note", 
        "strumming of chords is also possible in guitar fashion", 
        "col legno is the technique in which the player uses the wood rather than the hair of the bow on the strings; it takes two different forms col legno battuto and col legno tratto", 
        "col legno battuto is performed as a percussive technique with no sustaining of the sound", 
        "the much less common alternative is col legno tratto wherein the wood is drawn across the string as the hair is in a normal bow stroke", 
        "some players refuse to use this technique because of potential damage to the bow", 
        "in spiccato playing the strings are not drawn by the bow hair but struck by it while still retaining some horizontal motion to generate a more percussive crisp sound", 
        "it may be performed by using the wrist to dip the bow into the strings", 
        "spiccato is usually associated with lively playing", 
        "on a violin spiccato bowing comes off the string but on a cello the wood of the bow may rise briskly up without the hair actually leaving the string", 
        "while playing spiccato the bow is literally bouncing off the string", 
        "cello players simply dip the bow into the string and touch it very fast and then lift the bow off the string", 
        "in staccato the player moves the bow a small distance and stops it on the string making a short sound the rest of the written duration being taken up by silence", 
        "legato is a technique where the notes are smoothly connected without accents or breaks", 
        "sul ponticello on the bridge refers to bowing closer to the bridge while sul tasto on the fingerboard calls for bowing nearer the end of the fingerboard", 
        "ponticello calls for more bow weight and slower bow speed and produces a harder sound with strong overtone content", 
        "sul tasto in extreme cases called flautando produces a more flute like sound with more emphasis on the fundamental frequency of the note and softer overtones", 
        "1 8 size cello with full size cello standard sized cellos are referred to as full size", 
        "however cellos come in smaller fractional sizes from seven eighths and three quarter down to one sixteenth sized cellos e g",

        "a half size cello is not actually half the size of a full size but only slightly smaller", 
        "many smaller cellists prefer to play a seven eighths cello as the hand stretches in the lower positions are less demanding", 
        "although rare cellos in sizes larger than four fourths do exist", 
        "cellists with unusually large hands may play a slightly larger than full sized cello", 
        "cellos made before approximately 1700 tended to be considerably larger than those made after that date and than those made and commonly played today", 
        "around 1680 string making technology made lower pitches on shorter strings possible", 
        "the cellos of stradivari for example can be clearly divided into two models with the style made before 1702 characterized by larger instruments of which only three examples are extant in their original size and configuration and the style made during and after 1702 when stradivari presumably in response to the new type of strings began making cellos of a smaller size", 
        "this later model is the one most commonly used by modern luthiers", 
        "there are many accessories for the cello", 
        "cases are used to protect the cello and bow or multiple bows when traveling and for safe storage", 
        "they are often made of carbon fiber fiber glass and less commonly wood", 
        "rosin made from conifer resin is applied to the bow hairs to increase the effectiveness of the friction grip or bite and allow proper sound production",

        "he was an important contributor to the de stijl art movement and group which was founded by theo van doesburg", 
        "he evolved a non representational form which he termed neo plasticism", 
        "this consisted of white ground upon which was painted a grid of vertical and horizontal black lines and the three primary colours", 
        "mondrian s birthplace in amersfoort netherlands now the mondriaan house a museum", 
        "mondrian was born in amersfoort in the netherlands the second of his parents children", 
        "he was descended from christian dirkzoon monderyan who lived in the hague as early as 1670", 
        "the family moved to winterswijk when his father pieter cornelius mondriaan was appointed head teacher at a local primary school", 
        "between his 1905 painting the river amstel and his 1907 amaryllis mondrian changed the spelling of his signature from mondriaan to mondrian", 
        "mondrian was introduced to art from a very early age his father was a qualified drawing teacher and with his uncle fritz mondriaan a pupil of willem maris of the hague school of artists the younger piet often painted and drew along the river gein", 
        "after a strictly protestant upbringing in 1892 mondrian entered the academy for fine art in amsterdam already qualified as a teacher", 
        "he began his career as a teacher in primary education but while teaching he also practiced painting", 
        "most of his work from this period is naturalistic or impressionistic consisting largely of landscapes", 
        "these pastoral images of his native country depict windmills fields and rivers initially in the dutch impressionist manner of the hague school and then in a variety of styles and techniques documenting his search for a personal voice", 
        "these paintings are most definitely representational and illustrate the influence that various artistic movements had on mondrian including pointillism and the vivid colors of fauvism", 
        "on display in the hague s gemeentemuseum are a number of paintings from this period including such post impressionist works as the red mill and trees in moonlight", 
        "another painting evening avond 1908 a scene of haystacks in a field at dusk even augurs future developments by using a palette consisting almost entirely of red yellow and blue", 
        "although it is in no sense abstract avond is the earliest of mondrian s works to emphasize the primary colors", 
        "piet mondrian view from the dunes with beach and piers domburg oil and pencil on cardboard 1909 museum of modern art new york city the earliest paintings that show an inkling of the abstraction to come are a series of canvases from 1905 to 1908 which depict dim scenes of indistinct trees and houses with reflections in still water", 
        "however although the end result leads the viewer to begin emphasizing the forms over the content these paintings are still firmly rooted in nature and it is only the knowledge of mondrian s later achievements that leads one to search for the roots of his future abstraction in these works", 
        "mondrian s art was always intimately related to his spiritual and philosophical studies", 
        "in 1908 he became interested in the theosophical movement launched by helena petrovna blavatsky in the late 19th century", 
        "blavatsky believed that it was possible to attain a knowledge of nature more profound than that provided by empirical means and much of mondriaan s work for the rest of his life was inspired by his search for that spiritual knowledge", 
        "mondrian and his later work were deeply influenced by the 1911 moderne kunstkring exhibition of cubism in amsterdam", 
        "his search for simplification is shown in two versions of still life with ginger pot stilleven met gemberpot", 
        "the 1911 version is cubist in the 1912 version it is reduced to a round shape with triangles and rectangles", 
        "in 1911 mondrian moved to paris and changed his name dropping an a from mondriaan to emphasize his departure from the netherlands", 
        "from this point on he signed his work as mondrian", 
        "while in paris the influence of the style cubism of picasso and braque appeared almost immediately in mondrian s work", 
        "paintings such as the sea 1912 and his various studies of trees from that year still contain a measure of representation but they are increasingly dominated by the geometric shapes and interlocking planes commonly found in cubism", 
        "however while mondrian was eager to absorb the cubist influence into his work it seems clear that he saw cubism as port of call on his artistic journey rather than as a destination", 
        "unlike the cubists mondrian was still attempting to reconcile his painting with his spiritual pursuits and in 1913 he began to fuse his art and his theosophical studies into a theory that signaled his final break from representational painting", 
        "world war i began while mondrian was visiting home in 1914 and he was forced to remain in the netherlands for the duration of the conflict", 
        "during this period he stayed at the laren artist s colony there meeting bart van der leck and theo van doesburg both artists who were undergoing their own personal journeys toward abstraction at the time", 
        "van der leck s use of only primary colors in his art greatly influenced mondrian", 
        "with van doesburg mondrian founded de stijl the style a journal of de stijl group in which he published his first essays defining his theory for which he adopted the term neoplasticism", 
        "mondrian published de nieuwe beelding in de schilderkunst the new plastic in painting in twelve installments during 1917 and 1918", 
        "this was his first major attempt to express his artistic theory in writing", 
        "however mondrian s best and most often quoted expression of this theory comes from a letter he wrote to h p", 
        "bremmer in 1914 i construct lines and color combinations on a flat surface in order to express general beauty with the utmost awareness", 
        "nature or that which i see inspires me puts me as with any painter in an emotional state so that an urge comes about to make something but i want to come as close as possible to the truth and abstract everything from that until i reach the foundation still just an external foundation", 
        "of things i believe it is possible that through horizontal and vertical lines constructed with awareness but not with calculation led by high intuition and brought to harmony and rhythm these basic forms of beauty supplemented if necessary by other direct lines or curves can become a work of art as strong as it is true",

        "piet mondrian composition ii in red blue and yellow 1930 when the war ended in 1919 mondrian returned to france where he would remain until 1938", 
        "immersed in the crucible of artistic innovation that was post war paris he flourished in an atmosphere of intellectual freedom that enabled him to embrace an art of pure abstraction for the rest of his life", 
        "mondrian began producing grid based paintings in late 1919 and in 1920 the style for which he came to be renowned began to appear", 
        "in the early paintings of this style the lines delineating the rectangular forms are relatively thin and they are gray not black", 
        "the lines also tend to fade as they approach the edge of the painting rather than stopping abruptly", 
        "the forms themselves smaller and more numerous than in later paintings are filled with primary colors black or gray and nearly all of them are colored; only a few are left white", 
        "during late 1920 and 1921 mondrian s paintings arrive at what are their definitive and mature form to casual observers", 
        "thick black lines now separate the forms which are larger and fewer in number and more of them are left white than was previously the case", 
        "this was not the culmination of his artistic evolution however", 
        "although the refinements became more subtle mondrian s work continued to evolve during his years in paris", 
        "in the 1921 paintings many of the black lines but not all of them stop short at a seemingly arbitrary distance from the edge of the canvas although the divisions between the rectangular forms remain intact", 
        "here too the rectangular forms are still mostly colored", 
        "as the years passed and mondrian s work evolved further he began extending all of the lines to the edges of the canvas and he also began to use fewer and fewer colored forms favoring white instead", 
        "these tendencies are particularly obvious in the lozenge works that mondrian began producing with regularity in the mid 1920s", 
        "the lozenge paintings are square canvases tilted 45 degrees so that they hang in a diamond shape", 
        "typical of these is schilderij no", 
        "1 lozenge with two lines and blue 1926 also known as composition with blue and composition in white and blue which is currently on display at the philadelphia museum of art", 
        "one of the most minimal of mondrian s canvases this painting consists only of two black perpendicular lines and a small triangular form colored blue", 
        "the lines extend all the way to the edges of the canvas almost giving the impression that the painting is a fragment of a larger work", 
        "although one is hampered by the glass protecting the painting and by the toll that age and handling have obviously taken on the canvas a close examination of this painting begins to reveal something of the artist s method", 
        "mondrian s paintings are not composed of perfectly flat planes of color as one might expect", 
        "brush strokes are evident throughout although they are subtle and the artist appears to have used different techniques for the various elements", 
        "the black lines are the flattest elements with the least amount of depth", 
        "the colored forms have the most obvious brush strokes all running in one direction", 
        "most interesting however are the white forms which clearly have been painted in layers using brush strokes running in different directions", 
        "this generates a greater sense of depth in the white forms as though they are overwhelming the lines and the colors which indeed they were as mondrian s paintings of this period came to be increasingly dominated by white space", 
        "schilderij no", 
        "1 may be the most extreme extent of mondrian s minimalism", 
        "as the years progressed lines began to take precedence over forms in his painting", 
        "in the 1930s he began to use thinner lines and double lines more frequently punctuated with a few small colored forms if any at all", 
        "double lines particularly excited mondrian for he believed they offered his paintings a new dynamism which he was eager to explore", 
        "piet mondrian composition 10 1939 1942 private collection", 
        "in september 1938 mondrian left paris in the face of advancing fascism and moved to london", 
        "after the netherlands were invaded and paris fell in 1940 he left london for new york city where he would remain until his death", 
        "some of mondrian s later works are difficult to place in terms of his artistic development because there were quite a few canvases that he began in paris or london which he only completed months or years later in new york", 
        "however the finished works from this later period demonstrate an unprecedented busy ness with more lines than any of his work since the 1920s placed in an overlapping arrangement that is almost cartographical in appearance", 
        "he spent many long hours painting on his own until his hands blistered and he sometimes cried or made himself sick", 
        "mondrian produced lozenge composition with four yellow lines 1933 a simple painting that introduced what for him was a shocking innovation thick colored lines instead of black ones", 
        "after that one painting this practice remained dormant in mondrian s work until he arrived in new york at which time he began to embrace it with abandon", 
        "in some examples of this new direction such as composition 1938 place de la concorde 1943 he appears to have taken unfinished black line paintings from paris and completed them in new york by adding short perpendicular lines of different colors running between the longer black lines or from a black line to the edge of the canvas", 
        "the newly colored areas are thick almost bridging the gap between lines and forms and it is startling to see color in a mondrian painting that is unbounded by black", 
        "other works mix long lines of red amidst the familiar black lines creating a new sense of depth by the addition of a colored layer on top of the black one", 
        "the new canvases that mondrian began in new york are even more startling and indicate the beginning of a new idiom that was cut short by the artist s death", 
        "new york city 1942 is a complex lattice of red blue and yellow lines occasionally interlacing to create a greater sense of depth than his previous works", 
        "an unfinished 1941 version of this work uses strips of painted paper tape which the artist could rearrange at will to experiment with different designs", 
        "his painting broadway boogie woogie 1942 43 at the museum of modern art in new york city was highly influential in the school of abstract geometric painting", 
        "the piece is made up of a number of shimmering squares of bright color that leap from the canvas then appear to shimmer drawing the viewer into those neon lights", 
        "in this painting and the unfinished victory boogie woogie 1942 44 mondrian replaced former solid lines with lines created from small adjoining rectangles of color created in part by using small pieces of paper tape in various colors", 
        "larger unbounded rectangles of color punctuate the design some with smaller concentric rectangles inside them", 
        "while mondrian s works of the 1920s and 1930s tend to have an almost scientific austerity about them these are bright lively paintings reflecting the upbeat music that inspired them and the city in which they were made", 
        "mondrian wrote on a postcard to art historian james johnson sweeney planner of a retrospective exhibition of the artist s works at the museum of modern art in new york only now in 1943 i become conscious that my work in black white and little color planes has been merely drawing in oil color", 
        "in drawing the lines are the principal means of expression; in painting the color planes", 
        "in painting however the lines are absorbed by the color planes; but the limitation of the planes show themselves as lines and conserve their great value", 
        "in these final works the forms have indeed usurped the role of the lines opening another new door for mondrian s development as an abstractionist", 
        "the boogie woogie paintings were clearly more of a revolutionary change than an evolutionary one representing the most profound development in mondrian s work since his abandonment of representational art in 1913", 
        "in 2008 the dutch television program andere tijden found the only known movie footage with mondrian", 
        "the discovery of the film footage was announced at the end of a two year research program on the victory boogie woogie", 
        "the research found that the painting was in very good condition and that mondrian painted the composition in one session", 
        "it was also found that the composition was radically changed by mondrian shortly before his death by using small pieces of colored tape", 
        "when 47 year old piet mondrian left the netherlands for unfettered paris for the second and last time in 1919 he set about at once to make his studio a nurturing environment for paintings he had in mind that would increasingly express the principles of neo plasticism about which he had been writing for two years", 
        "to hide the studio s structural flaws quickly and inexpensively he tacked up large rectangular placards each in a single color or neutral hue", 
        "smaller colored paper squares and rectangles composed together accented the walls", 
        "then came an intense period of painting", 
        "then again he addressed the walls repositioning the colored cutouts adding to their number altering the dynamics of color and space producing new tensions and equilibrium", 
        "before long he had established a creative schedule in which a period of painting took turns with a period of experimentally regrouping the smaller papers on the walls a process that directly fed the next period of painting", 
        "it was a pattern he followed for the rest of his life through wartime moves from paris to london s hampstead in 1938 and 1940 across the atlantic to manhattan", 
        "at 71 in the fall of 1943 mondrian moved into his second and final new york studio at 15 east 59th street and set about again to create the environment he had learned over the years was most congenial to his modest way of life and most stimulating to his art", 
        "he painted the high walls the same off white he used on his easel and on the seats tables and storage cases he designed and fashioned meticulously from discarded orange and apple crates", 
        "he glossed the top of a white metal stool in the same brilliant primary red he applied to the cardboard sheath he made for the radio phonograph that spilled forth his beloved jazz from well traveled records visitors to this last studio seldom saw more than one or two new canvases but found often to their astonishment that eight large compositions of colored bits of paper he had tacked and re tacked to the walls in ever changing relationships constituted together an environment that paradoxically and simultaneously was both kinetic and serene stimulating and restful", 
        "it was the best space mondrian said that he had ever inhabited", 
        "tragically he was there for only a few months he died of pneumonia in february 1944", 
        "after his death mondrian s friend and sponsor in new york artist harry holtzman and another painter friend fritz glarner carefully documented the studio on film and in still photographs before opening it to the public for a six week exhibition", 
        "before dismantling the studio holtzman who was also mondrian s heir traced the wall compositions precisely prepared exact portable facsimiles of the space each had occupied and affixed to each the original surviving cut out components", 
        "these portable mondrian compositions have become known as the wall works", 
        "they have been exhibited twice since mondrian s death at new york s museum of modern art 1983 1995 96 once in soho at the carpenter hochman gallery 1984 once each at galerie tokoro in tokyo japan",

        "in toledo el greco received several major commissions and produced his best known paintings", 
        "el greco s dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century", 
        "el greco is regarded as a precursor of both expressionism and cubism while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as rainer maria rilke and nikos kazantzakis", 
        "el greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school", 
        "he is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation marrying byzantine traditions with those of western painting",

        "el greco received his initial training as an icon painter of the cretan school the leading centre of post byzantine art", 
        "in addition to painting he probably studied the classics of ancient greece and perhaps the latin classics also; he left a working library of 130 books at his death including the bible in greek and an annotated vasari", 
        "candia was a center for artistic activity where eastern and western cultures co existed harmoniously where around two hundred painters were active during the 16th century and had organized a painters guild based on the italian model", 
        "in 1563 at the age of twenty two el greco was described in a document as a master maestro domenigo meaning he was already a master of the guild and presumably operating his own workshop", 
        "three years later in june 1566 as a witness to a contract he signed his name as master menegos theotokopoulos painter", 
        "most scholars believe that the theotokopoulos family was almost certainly greek orthodox although some catholic sources still claim him from birth", 
        "like many orthodox emigrants to europe he apparently transferred to catholicism after his arrival and certainly practiced as a catholic in spain where he described himself as a devout catholic in his will", 
        "the extensive archival research conducted since the early 1960s by scholars such as nikolaos panayotakis pandelis prevelakis and maria constantoudaki indicates strongly that el greco s family and ancestors were greek orthodox",

        "though the exact year is not clear most scholars agree that el greco went to venice around 1567", 
        "knowledge of el greco s years in italy is limited", 
        "he lived in venice until 1570 and according to a letter written by his much older friend the greatest miniaturist of the age the croatian giulio clovio was a disciple of titian who was by then in his eighties but still vigorous", 
        "this may mean he worked in titian s large studio or not", 
        "clovio characterized el greco as a rare talent in painting", 
        "in 1570 el greco moved to rome where he executed a series of works strongly marked by his venetian apprenticeship",

        "sinai and a portrait of clovio are among them", 
        "unlike other cretan artists who had moved to venice el greco substantially altered his style and sought to distinguish himself by inventing new and unusual interpretations of traditional religious subject matter", 
        "his works painted in italy were influenced by the venetian renaissance style of the period with agile elongated figures reminiscent of tintoretto and a chromatic framework that connects him to titian", 
        "the venetian painters also taught him to organize his multi figured compositions in landscapes vibrant with atmospheric light", 
        "clovio reports visiting el greco on a summer s day while the artist was still in rome", 
        "el greco was sitting in a darkened room because he found the darkness more conducive to thought than the light of the day which disturbed his inner light", 
        "as a result of his stay in rome his works were enriched with elements such as violent perspective vanishing points or strange attitudes struck by the figures with their repeated twisting and turning and tempestuous gestures; all elements of mannerism", 
        "by the time el greco arrived in rome michelangelo and raphael were dead but their example continued to be paramount and left little room for different approaches", 
        "although the artistic heritage of these great masters was overwhelming for young painters el greco was determined to make his own mark in rome defending his personal artistic views ideas and style", 
        "he singled out correggio and parmigianino for particular praise but he did not hesitate to dismiss michelangelo s last judgment in the sistine chapel; he extended an offer to pope pius v to paint over the whole work in accord with the new and stricter catholic thinking", 
        "when he was later asked what he thought about michelangelo el greco replied that he was a good man but he did not know how to paint", 
        "and thus we are confronted by a paradox el greco is said to have reacted most strongly or even condemned michelangelo but he had found it impossible to withstand his influence", 
        "michelangelo s influence can be seen in later el greco works such as the allegory of the holy league", 
        "by painting portraits of michelangelo titian clovio and presumably raphael in one of his works the purification of the temple el greco not only expressed his gratitude but advanced the claim to rival these masters", 
        "as his own commentaries indicate el greco viewed titian michelangelo and raphael as models to emulate", 
        "in his 17th century chronicles giulio mancini included el greco among the painters who had initiated in various ways a re evaluation of michelangelo s teachings", 
        "because of his unconventional artistic beliefs such as his dismissal of michelangelo s technique and personality el greco soon acquired enemies in rome",

        "el greco did not plan to settle permanently in toledo since his final aim was to win the favor of philip and make his mark in his court",

        "the exact reasons for the king s dissatisfaction remain unclear", 
        "some scholars have suggested that philip did not like the inclusion of living persons in a religious scene; some others that el greco s works violated a basic rule of the counter reformation namely that in the image the content was paramount rather than the style", 
        "philip took a close interest in his artistic commissions and had very decided tastes; a long sought after sculpted crucifixion by benvenuto cellini also failed to please when it arrived and was likewise exiled to a less prominent place",

        "between 1607 and 1608 el greco was involved in a protracted legal dispute with the authorities of the hospital of charity at illescas concerning payment for his work which included painting sculpture and architecture; this and other legal disputes contributed to the economic difficulties he experienced towards the end of his life",

        "he was buried in the church of santo domingo el antigua aged 73", 
        "the primacy of imagination and intuition over the subjective character of creation was a fundamental principle of el greco s style", 
        "el greco discarded classicist criteria such as measure and proportion", 
        "he believed that grace is the supreme quest of art but the painter achieves grace only if he manages to solve the most complex problems with obvious ease", 
        "el greco regarded color as the most important and the most ungovernable element of painting and declared that color had primacy over form", 
        "francisco pacheco a painter and theoretician who visited el greco in 1611 wrote that the painter liked the colors crude and unmixed in great blots as a boastful display of his dexterity and that he believed in constant repainting and retouching in order to make the broad masses tell flat as in nature", 
        "the disrobing of christ 1577 1579 oil on canvas sacristy of the cathedral toledo is one of the most famous altarpieces of el greco",

        "art historian max dvorak was the first scholar to connect el greco s art with mannerism and antinaturalism", 
        "modern scholars characterize el greco s theory as typically mannerist and pinpoint its sources in the neo platonism of the renaissance", 
        "jonathan brown believes that el greco endeavored to create a sophisticated form of art; according to nicholas penny once in spain el greco was able to create a style of his own one that disavowed most of the descriptive ambitions of painting", 
        "in his mature works el greco demonstrated a characteristic tendency to dramatize rather than to describe", 
        "the strong spiritual emotion transfers from painting directly to the audience", 
        "according to pacheco el greco s perturbed violent and at times seemingly careless in execution art was due to a studied effort to acquire a freedom of style", 
        "el greco s preference for exceptionally tall and slender figures and elongated compositions which served both his expressive purposes and aesthetic principles led him to disregard the laws of nature and elongate his compositions to ever greater extents particularly when they were destined for altarpieces", 
        "the anatomy of the human body becomes even more otherworldly in el greco s mature works; for the virgin of the immaculate conception el greco asked to lengthen the altarpiece itself by another because in this way the form will be perfect and not reduced which is the worst thing that can happen to a figure", 
        "a significant innovation of el greco s mature works is the interweaving between form and space; a reciprocal relationship is developed between the two which completely unifies the painting surface", 
        "this interweaving would re emerge three centuries later in the works of cezanne and picasso", 
        "another characteristic of el greco s mature style is the use of light", 
        "as jonathan brown notes each figure seems to carry its own light within or reflects the light that emanates from an unseen source", 
        "fernando marias and agustin bustamante garcia the scholars who transcribed el greco s handwritten notes connect the power that the painter gives to light with the ideas underlying christian neo platonism",

        "he believes that in el greco s mature works the devotional intensity of mood reflects the religious spirit of roman catholic spain in the period of the counter reformation", 
        "view of toledo c 1596 1600 oil on canvas metropolitan museum of art new york is one of the two surviving landscapes of toledo painted by el greco", 
        "el greco also excelled as a portraitist able not only to record a sitter s features but also to convey their character", 
        "his portraits are fewer in number than his religious paintings but are of equally high quality", 
        "wethey says that by such simple means the artist created a memorable characterization that places him in the highest rank as a portraitist along with titian and rembrandt", 
        "since the beginning of the 20th century scholars have debated whether el greco s style had byzantine origins", 
        "certain art historians had asserted that el greco s roots were firmly in the byzantine tradition and that his most individual characteristics derive directly from the art of his ancestors while others had argued that byzantine art could not be related to el greco s later work", 
        "the discovery of the dormition of the virgin on syros an authentic and signed work from the painter s cretan period and the extensive archival research in the early 1960s contributed to the rekindling and reassessment of these theories", 
        "although following many conventions of the byzantine icon aspects of the style certainly show venetian influence and the composition showing the death of mary combines the different doctrines of the orthodox dormition of the virgin and the catholic assumption of the virgin", 
        "significant scholarly works of the second half of the 20th century devoted to el greco reappraise many of the interpretations of his work including his supposed byzantinism", 
        "based on the notes written in el greco s own hand on his unique style and on the fact that el greco signed his name in greek characters they see an organic continuity between byzantine painting and his art", 
        "according to marina lambraki plaka far from the influence of italy in a neutral place which was intellectually similar to his birthplace candia the byzantine elements of his education emerged and played a catalytic role in the new conception of the image which is presented to us in his mature work", 
        "in making this judgement lambraki plaka disagrees with oxford university professors cyril mango and elizabeth jeffreys who assert that despite claims to the contrary the only byzantine element of his famous paintings was his signature in greek lettering",

        "he asserts that the philosophies of platonism and ancient neo platonism the works of plotinus and pseudo dionysius the areopagite the texts of the church fathers and the liturgy offer the keys to the understanding of el greco s style", 
        "summarizing the ensuing scholarly debate on this issue jose alvarez lopera curator at the museo del prado madrid concludes that the presence of byzantine memories is obvious in el greco s mature works though there are still some obscure issues concerning his byzantine origins needing further illumination", 
        "el greco was highly esteemed as an architect and sculptor during his lifetime", 
        "he usually designed complete altar compositions working as architect and sculptor as well as painter at for instance the hospital de la caridad", 
        "there he decorated the chapel of the hospital but the wooden altar and the sculptures he created have in all probability perished", 
        "for the master designed the original altar of gilded wood which has been destroyed but his small sculptured group of the miracle of st ildefonso still survives on the lower centre of the frame", 
        "his most important architectural achievement was the church and monastery of santo domingo el antiguo for which he also executed sculptures and paintings", 
        "el greco is regarded as a painter who incorporated architecture in his painting", 
        "he is also credited with the architectural frames to his own paintings in toledo", 
        "pacheco characterized him as a writer of painting sculpture and architecture", 
        "in the marginalia that el greco inscribed in his copy of daniele barbaro s translation of vitruvius he refuted vitruvius attachment to archaeological remains canonical proportions perspective and mathematics", 
        "he also saw vitruvius manner of distorting proportions in order to compensate for distance from the eye as responsible for creating monstrous forms", 
        "el greco was averse to the very idea of rules in architecture; he believed above all in the freedom of invention and defended novelty variety and complexity",

        "el greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early baroque style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th century mannerism", 
        "el greco was deemed incomprehensible and had no important followers", 
        "only his son and a few unknown painters produced weak copies of his works", 
        "late 17th and early 18th century spanish commentators praised his skill but criticized his antinaturalistic style and his complex iconography", 
        "some of these commentators such as acislo antonio palomino de castro y velasco and juan agustin cean bermudez described his mature work as contemptible ridiculous and worthy of scorn", 
        "the views of palomino and bermudez were frequently repeated in spanish historiography adorned with terms such as strange queer original eccentric and odd", 
        "the phrase sunk in eccentricity often encountered in such texts in time developed into madness", 
        "with the arrival of romantic sentiments in the late 18th century el greco s works were examined anew", 
        "to french writer theophile gautier el greco was the precursor of the european romantic movement in all its craving for the strange and the extreme",

        "these are the words meier graefe used to describe el greco s impact on the artistic movements of his time to the english artist and critic roger fry in 1920 el greco was the archetypal genius who did as he thought best with complete indifference to what effect the right expression might have on the public", 
        "fry described el greco as an old master who is not merely modern but actually appears a good many steps ahead of us turning back to show us the way", 
        "during the same period other researchers developed alternate more radical theories", 
        "the physicians august goldschmidt and german beritens argued that el greco painted such elongated human figures because he had vision problems possibly progressive astigmatism or strabismus that made him see bodies longer than they were and at an angle to the perpendicular; the physician arturo perera however attributed this style to the use of marijuana", 
        "michael kimmelman a reviewer for the new york times stated that to greeks el greco became the quintessential greek painter; to the spanish the quintessential spaniard",

        "according to efi foundoulaki painters and theoreticians from the beginning of the 20th century discovered a new el greco but in process they also discovered and revealed their own selves",

        "to the blaue reiter group in munich in 1912 el greco typified that mystical inner construction that it was the task of their generation to rediscover", 
        "the first painter who appears to have noticed the structural code in the morphology of the mature el greco was paul cezanne one of the forerunners of cubism", 
        "comparative morphological analyses of the two painters revealed their common elements such as the distortion of the human body the reddish and in appearance only unworked backgrounds and the similarities in the rendering of space", 
        "according to brown cezanne and el greco are spiritual brothers despite the centuries which separate them",

        "a harmonic is a frequency that is a whole number multiple of a lower register or fundamental note of the flute", 
        "generally the air stream is thinner vibrating in more modes faster providing more energy to excite the air s resonance and aimed across the hole less deeply permitting a more shallow deflection of the air stream in the production of higher harmonics or upper partials",

        "packs of wolves cooperatively hunt any large herbivores in their range", 
        "pack hunting revolves around the chase as wolves are able to run for long periods before relenting", 
        "it takes careful cooperation for a pack to take down large prey and the rate of success for such chase is very low", 
        "wolves in the interest of saving energy will only chase one potential prey for the first thousand or so meters before giving up and trying at a different time against a different prey", 
        "therefore like most other pack species wolves must hunt continually to sustain themselves",

        "this defensive technique increases the possibility of injury to the preying wolves", 
        "the wolves not willing to risk injury are more likely to yield when encountered with such a bold individual", 
        "instead they will try to target weaker prey members that are easier and safer to hunt", 
        "wolves are generally inefficient at killing large healthy prey with success rates as low as 20 which is due in part to the large size and defensive capabilities of their prey", 
        "like many other keystone predators wolves are sensitive to fluctuations in the abundance of prey", 
        "they are likely to have minor changes in their populations as the abundance of their primary prey species gradually rises and drops over long periods of time",

        "surplus killing is defined as the killing of several prey animals too numerous to eat at one sitting",

        "an instance of surplus killing by wolves was witnessed in canada s northwest territories by researchers coming across 34 neonatal caribou calves scattered over three square kilometres", 
        "the wolves had eaten only a few parts from half the calves and not touched the rest",

        "these contain magnets that are tightly wrapped in a coil or coils of copper wire",

        "electromagnetic pickups work on the same principles and in a similar manner to an electrical generator", 
        "the vibration of the strings causes a small voltage to be created in the coils surrounding the magnets; this signal voltage is later amplified", 
        "traditional electromagnetic pickups are either single coil or double coil", 
        "single coil pickups are susceptible to noise induced from electric fields usually mains frequency 60 or 50 hertz hum", 
        "the introduction of the double coil humbucker in the mid 1950s did away with this problem through the use of two coils one of which is wired in a reverse polarity orientation",

        "typically humbuckers which are two magnet coil assemblies attached to each other are traditionally associated with a heavier sound", 
        "single coil pickups one magnet wrapped in copper wire are used by guitarists seeking a brighter twangier sound with greater dynamic range", 
        "modern pickups are tailored to the sound desired", 
        "a commonly applied approximation used in selection of a pickup is that less wire lower dc resistance brighter sound more wire fat tone", 
        "other options include specialized switching that produces coil splitting in out of phase and other effects", 
        "guitar circuits are either active needing a battery to power their circuit or as in most cases equipped with a passive circuit",

        "a crystal is located under each string usually in the saddle", 
        "when the string vibrates the shape of the crystal is distorted and the stresses associated with this change produce tiny voltages across the crystal that can be amplified and manipulated", 
        "some piezo equipped guitars use what is known as a hexaphonic pickup", 
        "hex is a prefix meaning six", 
        "in a hexaphonic pickup separate outputs are obtained from discrete piezoelectric pickups for each of the six strings", 
        "this arrangement allows the signal to be easily modified by on board modelling electronics as in the line 6 variax brand of electric guitars; the guitars allow for a variety of different sounds to be obtained by digitally manipulating the signal", 
        "this allows a guitar to mimic many vintage models of guitar as well as output alternate tunings without the need to adjust the strings", 
        "another use for hexaphonic pickups is to send the output signals to a midi interpretation device which determines the note pitch duration attack and decay characteristics and so forth", 
        "the midi musical instrument digital interface interpreter then sends the note information to a sound bank device", 
        "the resulting sound can closely mimic numerous types of instruments", 
        "on guitars that have them these components and the wires that connect them allow the player to control some aspects of the sound like volume or tone", 
        "these at their simplest consist of passive components such as potentiometers and capacitors but may also include specialized integrated circuits or other active components requiring batteries for power for preamplification and signal processing or even for assistance in tuning", 
        "in many cases the electronics have some sort of shielding to prevent pickup of external interference and noise", 
        "the top back and ribs of an acoustic guitar body are very thin 1 2 mm so a flexible piece of wood called lining is glued into the corners where the rib meets the top and back", 
        "this interior reinforcement provides 5 to 20 mm of solid gluing area for these corner joints", 
        "solid linings are often used in classical guitars while kerfed lining is most often found in steel string acoustics", 
        "kerfed lining is also called kerfing because it is scored or kerfed to allow it to bend with the shape of the rib", 
        "during final construction a small section of the outside corners is carved or routed out and then filled with binding material on the outside corners and decorative strips of material next to the binding which are called purfling",

        "the main purpose of the bridge on an acoustic guitar is to transfer the vibration from the strings to the soundboard which vibrates the air inside of the guitar thereby amplifying the sound produced by the strings", 
        "on both electric and acoustic guitars the bridge holds the strings in place on the body", 
        "there are many varied bridge designs", 
        "there may be some mechanism for raising or lowering the bridge to adjust the distance between the strings and the fretboard action and or fine tuning the intonation of the instrument", 
        "some are spring loaded and feature a whammy bar a removable arm which allows the player to modulate the pitch moving the bridge up and down", 
        "the whammy bar is sometimes also referred to as a tremolo bar see tremolo for further discussion of this term the effect of rapidly changing pitch produced by a whammy bar is more correctly called vibrato",

        "in general flat notes are corrected by moving the bridge forward and sharp notes by moving it backwards", 
        "on an instrument correctly adjusted for intonation the actual length of each string from the nut to the bridge saddle will be slightly but measurably longer than the scale length of the instrument", 
        "this additional length is called compensation which flattens all notes a bit to compensate for the sharping of all fretted notes caused by stretching the string during fretting",

        "leo fender who did much to create the electric guitar also created much confusion over the meaning of the terms tremolo and vibrato specifically by misnaming the tremolo unit on many of his guitars and also the vibrato unit on his vibrolux amps", 
        "in general vibrato is a variation in pitch whereas tremolo is a variation in volume so the tremolo bar is actually a vibrato bar and the vibrolux amps actually had a tremolo effect",

        "the exception is the interval between the second and third strings in which the 4th fret note on the third string is equivalent to the open second string",

        "in 1930 following his brother charles pollock he moved to new york city where they both studied under thomas hart benton at the art students league of new york", 
        "benton s rural american subject matter shaped pollock s work only fleetingly but his rhythmic use of paint and his fierce independence were more lasting influences",

        "it was there that he perfected the technique of working spontaneously with liquid paint", 
        "pollock was introduced to the use of liquid paint in 1936 at an experimental workshop operated in new york city by the mexican muralist david alfaro siqueiros", 
        "he later used paint pouring as one of several techniques on canvases of the early 1940s such as male and female and composition with pouring i", 
        "after his move to springs he began painting with his canvases laid out on the studio floor and he developed what was later called his drip technique", 
        "therefore pollock turned to synthetic resin based paints called alkyd enamels which at that time was a novel medium", 
        "pollock described this use of household paints instead of artist s paints as a natural growth out of a need", 
        "he used hardened brushes sticks and even basting syringes as paint applicators", 
        "pollock s technique of pouring and dripping paint is thought to be one of the origins of the term action painting", 
        "with this technique pollock was able to achieve a more immediate means of creating art the paint now literally flowing from his chosen tool onto the canvas", 
        "by defying the convention of painting on an upright surface he added a new dimension literally by being able to view and apply paint to his canvases from all directions", 
        "in the process of making paintings in this way he moved away from figurative representation and challenged the western tradition of using easel and brush", 
        "he also moved away from the use of only the hand and wrist since he used his whole body to paint",

        "it was a mixture of controllable and uncontrollable factors",

        "leonardo has often been described as the archetype of the renaissance man a man whose unquenchable curiosity was equaled only by his powers of invention", 
        "he is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived", 
        "according to art historian helen gardner the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent and his mind and personality seem to us superhuman the man himself mysterious and remote", 
        "marco rosci points out however that while there is much speculation about the man himself leonardo s vision of the world is essentially logical rather than mysterious and that the empirical methods he employed were unusual for his time", 
        "born the illegitimate son of a notary piero da vinci and a peasant woman caterina at vinci in the region of florence leonardo was educated in the studio of the renowned florentine painter verrocchio", 
        "much of his earlier working life was spent in the service of ludovico il moro in milan", 
        "he later worked in rome bologna and venice and spent his last years in france at the home awarded him by francis i leonardo was and is renowned primarily as a painter", 
        "two of his works the mona lisa and the last supper are the most famous most reproduced and most parodied portrait and religious painting of all time respectively their fame approached only by michelangelo s creation of adam", 
        "leonardo s drawing of the vitruvian man is also regarded as a cultural icon being reproduced on everything from the euro to text books to t shirts", 
        "perhaps fifteen of his paintings survive the small number due to his constant and frequently disastrous experimentation with new techniques and his chronic procrastination", 
        "nevertheless these few works together with his notebooks which contain drawings scientific diagrams and his thoughts on the nature of painting comprise a contribution to later generations of artists only rivalled by that of his contemporary michelangelo", 
        "leonardo is revered for his technological ingenuity", 
        "he conceptualised a helicopter a tank concentrated solar power a calculator the double hull and outlined a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics", 
        "relatively few of his designs were constructed or were even feasible during his lifetime but some of his smaller inventions such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire entered the world of manufacturing unheralded",

        "the second occurred while exploring in the mountains", 
        "he discovered a cave and was both terrified that some great monster might lurk there and driven by curiosity to find out what was inside", 
        "leonardo s early life has been the subject of historical conjecture", 
        "vasari the 16th century biographer of renaissance painters tells of how a local peasant made himself a round shield and requested that ser piero have it painted for him", 
        "leonardo responded with a painting of monster spitting fire which was so terrifying that ser piero sold it to a florentine art dealer who sold it to the duke of milan",

        "leonardo would have been exposed to both theoretical training and a vast range of technical skills including drafting chemistry metallurgy metal working plaster casting leather working mechanics and carpentry as well as the artistic skills of drawing painting sculpting and modelling", 
        "much of the painted production of verrocchio s workshop was done by his employees", 
        "according to vasari leonardo collaborated with verrocchio on his baptism of christ painting the young angel holding jesus s robe in a manner that was so far superior to his master s that verrocchio put down his brush and never painted again", 
        "this is probably an exaggeration", 
        "on close examination the painting reveals much that has been painted or touched up over the tempera using the new technique of oil paint the landscape the rocks that can be seen through the brown mountain stream and much of the figure of jesus bearing witness to the hand of leonardo",

        "by 1472 at the age of twenty leonardo qualified as a master in the guild of st luke the guild of artists and doctors of medicine but even after his father set him up in his own workshop his attachment to verrocchio was such that he continued to collaborate with him leonardo s earliest known dated work is a drawing in pen and ink of the arno valley drawn on august 5 1473 alt an unfinished painting showing the virgin mary and christ child surrounded by many figures who are all crowding to look at the baby",

        "neither important commission was completed the second being interrupted when leonardo went to milan", 
        "in 1482 leonardo who according to vasari was a most talented musician created a silver lyre in the shape of a horse s head", 
        "lorenzo de medici sent leonardo bearing the lyre as a gift to milan to secure peace with ludovico il moro duke of milan",

        "with ludovico sforza overthrown leonardo with his assistant salai and friend the mathematician luca pacioli fled milan for venice where he was employed as a military architect and engineer devising methods to defend the city from naval attack", 
        "on his return to florence in 1500 he and his household were guests of the servite monks at the monastery of santissima annunziata and were provided with a workshop where according to vasari leonardo created the cartoon of the virgin and child with st anne and st john the baptist a work that won such admiration that men and women young and old flocked to see it as if they were attending a great festival", 
        "in 1502 leonardo entered the service of cesare borgia the son of pope alexander vi acting as a military architect and engineer and travelling throughout italy with his patron", 
        "he returned to florence where he rejoined the guild of st luke on october 18 1503 and spent two years designing and painting a great mural of the battle of anghiari for the signoria with michelangelo designing its companion piece the battle of cascina", 
        "in florence in 1504 he was part of a committee formed to relocate against the artist s will michelangelo s statue of david", 
        "in 1506 he returned to milan", 
        "many of leonardo s most prominent pupils or followers in painting either knew or worked with him in milan including bernardino luini giovanni antonio boltraffio and marco d oggione", 
        "d oggione is known in part for his contemporary copies of the last supper", 
        "however he did not stay in milan for long because his father had died in 1504 and in 1507 he was back in florence trying to sort out problems with his brothers over his father s estate", 
        "by 1508 he was back in milan living in his own house in porta orientale in the parish of santa babila", 
        "alt photo of a large medieval house built of brick with many windows and gables and a circular tower with a conical roof", 
        "from september 1513 to 1516 leonardo spent much of his time living in the belvedere in the vatican in rome where raphael and michelangelo were both active at the time", 
        "in october 1515 francis i of france recaptured milan", 
        "on december 19 leonardo was present at the meeting of francis i and pope leo x which took place in bologna", 
        "it was for francis that leonardo was commissioned to make a mechanical lion which could walk forward then open its chest to reveal a cluster of lilies", 
        "in 1516 he entered francois service being given the use of the manor house clos luce clos luce also called cloux is now a public museum", 
        "near the king s residence at the royal chateau amboise", 
        "it was here that he spent the last three years of his life accompanied by his friend and apprentice count francesco melzi supported by a pension totalling 10 000 scudi", 
        "leonardo died at clos luce on may 2 1519", 
        "francis i had become a close friend", 
        "vasari records that the king held leonardo s head in his arms as he died although this story beloved by the french and portrayed in romantic paintings by ingres menageot and other french artists as well as by angelica kauffmann may be legend rather than fact", 
        "vasari also tells us that in his last days leonardo sent for a priest to make his confession and to receive the holy sacrament", 
        "in accordance to his will sixty beggars followed his casket", 
        "he was buried in the chapel of saint hubert in the castle of amboise", 
        "melzi was the principal heir and executor receiving as well as money leonardo s paintings tools library and personal effects", 
        "leonardo also remembered his other long time pupil and companion salai and his servant battista di vilussis who each received half of leonardo s vineyards his brothers who received land and his serving woman who received a black cloak of good stuff with a fur edge", 
        "some twenty years after leonardo s death francis was reported by the goldsmith and sculptor benevenuto cellini as saying there had never been another man born in the world who knew as much as leonardo not so much about painting sculpture and architecture as that he was a very great philosopher", 
        "ghiberti s gates of paradise 1425 1452 were a source of communal pride", 
        "many artists assisted in their creation", 
        "florence at the time of leonardo s youth was the centre of humanist thought and culture", 
        "leonardo commenced his apprenticeship with verrocchio in 1466 the year that verrocchio s master the great sculptor donatello died", 
        "the painter uccello whose early experiments with perspective were to influence the development of landscape painting was a very old man", 
        "the painters piero della francesca and fra filippo lippi sculptor luca della robbia and architect and writer leon battista alberti were in their sixties", 
        "the successful artists of the next generation were leonardo s teacher verrocchio antonio pollaiuolo and the portrait sculptor mino da fiesole whose lifelike busts give the most reliable likenesses of lorenzo medici s father piero and uncle giovanni", 
        "leonardo s youth was spent in a florence that was ornamented by the works of these artists and by donatello s contemporaries masaccio whose figurative frescoes were imbued with realism and emotion and ghiberti whose gates of paradise gleaming with gold leaf displayed the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds", 
        "piero della francesca had made a detailed study of perspective and was the first painter to make a scientific study of light", 
        "these studies and alberti s treatise were to have a profound effect on younger artists and in particular on leonardo s own observations and artworks", 
        "massaccio s depiction of the naked and distraught adam and eve leaving the garden of eden created a powerfully expressive image of the human form cast into three dimensions by the use of light and shade which was to be developed in the works of leonardo in a way that was to be influential in the course of painting", 
        "the humanist influence of donatello s david can be seen in leonardo s late paintings particularly john the baptist", 
        "small devotional picture by verrocchio c 1470 a prevalent tradition in florence was the small altarpiece of the virgin and child", 
        "many of these were created in tempera or glazed terracotta by the workshops of filippo lippi verrocchio and the prolific della robbia family", 
        "leonardo s early madonnas such as the the madonna with a carnation and the benois madonna followed this tradition while showing idiosyncratic departures particularly in the case of the benois madonna in which the virgin is set at an oblique angle to the picture space with the christ child at the opposite angle", 
        "this compositional theme was to emerge in leonardo s later paintings such as the virgin and child with st anne", 
        "leonardo was a contemporary of botticelli domenico ghirlandaio and perugino who were all slightly older than he was", 
        "he would have met them at the workshop of verrocchio with whom they had associations and at the academy of the medici", 
        "botticelli was a particular favourite of the medici family and thus his success as a painter was assured", 
        "ghirlandaio and perugino were both prolific and ran large workshops", 
        "they competently delivered commissions to well satisfied patrons who appreciated ghirlandaio s ability to portray the wealthy citizens of florence within large religious frescoes and perugino s ability to deliver a multitude of saints and angels of unfailing sweetness and innocence", 
        "these three were among those commissioned to paint the walls of the sistine chapel the work commencing with perugino s employment in 1479", 
        "leonardo was not part of this prestigious commission", 
        "his first significant commission the adoration of the magi for the monks of scopeto was never completed", 
        "in 1476 during the time of leonardo s association with verrocchio s workshop the portinari altarpiece by hugo van der goes arrived in florence bringing new painterly techniques from northern europe which were to profoundly effect leonardo ghirlandaio perugino and others", 
        "in 1479 the sicilian painter antonello da messina who worked exclusively in oils traveled north on his way to venice where the leading painter giovanni bellini adopted the technique of oil painting quickly making it the preferred method in venice", 
        "leonardo was also later to visit venice", 
        "like the two contemporary architects bramante and antonio da sangallo the elder leonardo experimented with designs for centrally planned churches a number of which appear in his journals as both plans and views although none was ever realised", 
        "lorenzo de medici between antonio pucci and francesco sassetti with giulio de medici fresco by ghirlandaio leonardo s political contemporaries were lorenzo medici il magnifico who was three years older and his popular younger brother giuliano who was slain in the pazzi conspiracy in 1478", 
        "ludovico il moro who ruled milan between 1479 1499 and to whom leonardo was sent as ambassador from the medici court was also of leonardo s age", 
        "with alberti leonardo visited the home of the medici and through them came to know the older humanist philosophers of whom marsiglio ficino proponent of neo platonism cristoforo landino writer of commentaries on classical writings and john argyropoulos teacher of greek and translator of aristotle were foremost", 
        "also associated with the academy of the medici was leonardo s contemporary the brilliant young poet and philosopher pico della mirandola", 
        "leonardo later wrote in the margin of a journal the medici made me and the medici destroyed me", 
        "while it was through the action of lorenzo that leonardo was to receive his important milanese commissions it is not known exactly what leonardo meant by this cryptic comment", 
        "although usually named together as the three giants of the high renaissance leonardo michelangelo and raphael were not of the same generation", 
        "leonardo was twenty three when michelangelo was born and thirty one when raphael was born", 
        "raphael only lived until the age of 37 and died in 1520 the year after leonardo but michelangelo went on creating for another 45 years", 
        "study for a portrait of isabella d este 1500 louvre", 
        "within leonardo s lifetime his extraordinary powers of invention his outstanding physical beauty infinite grace great strength and generosity regal spirit and tremendous breadth of mind as described by vasari as well as all other aspects of his life attracted the curiosity of others", 
        "one such aspect is his respect for life evidenced by his vegetarianism and his habit described by vasari of purchasing caged birds and releasing them", 
        "leonardo had many friends who are now renowned either in their fields or for their historical significance", 
        "they included the mathematician luca pacioli with whom he collaborated on a book in the 1490s as well as franchinus gaffurius and isabella d este", 
        "leonardo appears to have had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with isabella d este", 
        "he drew a portrait of her while on a journey which took him through mantua and which appears to have been used to create a painted portrait now lost", 
        "beyond friendship leonardo kept his private life secret", 
        "his sexuality has been the subject of satire analysis and speculation", 
        "this trend began in the mid 16th century and was revived in the 19th and 20th centuries most notably by sigmund freud", 
        "leonardo s most intimate relationships were perhaps with his pupils salai and melzi melzi describing leonardo s feelings for him as both loving and intensely passionate", 
        "it has been claimed since the 16th century that these relationships were of a sexual or erotic nature", 
        "court records of 1476 when he was aged twenty four show that leonardo and three other young men were charged with sodomy and acquitted", 
        "since that date much has been written about his presumed homosexuality and its role in his art particularly in the androgyny and eroticism manifested in john the baptist and bacchus and more explicitly in a number of erotic drawings", 
        "salai as john the baptist c 1514 louvre gian giacomo caprotti da oreno nicknamed salai or il salaino the little unclean one i e the devil entered leonardo s household in 1490", 
        "after only a year leonardo made a list of his misdemeanours calling him a thief a liar stubborn and a glutton after he had made off with money and valuables on at least five occasions and spent a fortune on clothes", 
        "nevertheless leonardo treated him with great indulgence and he remained in leonardo s household for the next thirty years", 
        "salai executed a number of paintings under the name of andrea salai but although vasari claims that leonardo taught him a great deal about painting his work is generally considered to be of less artistic merit than others among leonardo s pupils such as marco d oggione and boltraffio", 
        "in 1515 he painted a nude version of the mona lisa known as monna vanna", 
        "salai owned the mona lisa at the time of his death in 1525 and in his will it was assessed at 505 lire an exceptionally high valuation for a small panel portrait", 
        "in 1506 leonardo took on another pupil count francesco melzi the son of a lombard aristocrat who is considered to have been his favourite student", 
        "he travelled to france with leonardo and remained with him until the latter s death", 
        "upon leonardo s death melzi inherited the artistic and scientific works manuscripts and collections of leonardo and faithfully administered the estate", 
        "annunciation 1475 1480 uffizi is thought to be leonardo s earliest complete work despite the recent awareness and admiration of leonardo as a scientist and inventor for the better part of four hundred years his enormous fame rested on his achievements as a painter and on a handful of works either authenticated or attributed to him that have been regarded as among the supreme masterpieces ever created", 
        "by the 1490s leonardo had already been described as a divine painter", 
        "these paintings are famous for a variety of qualities which have been much imitated by students and discussed at great length by connoisseurs and critics", 
        "among the qualities that make leonardo s work unique are the innovative techniques that he used in laying on the paint his detailed knowledge of anatomy light botany and geology his interest in physiognomy and the way in which humans register emotion in expression and gesture his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition and his use of the subtle gradation of tone", 
        "all these qualities come together in his most famous painted works the mona lisa the last supper and the virgin of the rocks", 
        "unfinished painting of st jerome in the wilderness c 1480 vatican leonardo s early works begin with the baptism of christ painted in conjunction with verrocchio", 
        "two other paintings appear to date from his time at the workshop both of which are annunciations", 
        "one is small long and high", 
        "it is a predella to go at the base of a larger composition in this case a painting by lorenzo di credi from which it has become separated", 
        "the other is a much larger work", 
        "in both these annunciations leonardo has used a formal arrangement such as in fra angelico s two well known pictures of the same subject of the virgin mary sitting or kneeling to the right of the picture approached from the left by an angel in profile with rich flowing garment raised wings and bearing a lily", 
        "although previously attributed to ghirlandaio the larger work is now almost universally attributed to leonardo", 
        "in the smaller picture mary averts her eyes and folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised submission to god s will", 
        "in the larger picture however mary is not in the least submissive", 
        "the beautiful girl interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise", 
        "this calm young woman appears to accept her role as the mother of god not with resignation but with confidence", 
        "in this painting the young leonardo presents the humanist face of the virgin mary recognising humanity s role in god s incarnation", 
        "virgin of the rocks louvre possibly 1505 1508 demonstrates leonardo s interest in nature", 
        "in the 1480s leonardo received two very important commissions and commenced another work which was also of ground breaking importance in terms of composition", 
        "unfortunately two of the three were never finished and the third took so long that it was subject to lengthy negotiations over completion and payment", 
        "one of these paintings is that of st jerome in the wilderness", 
        "bortolon associates this picture with a difficult period of leonardo s life and the signs of melancholy in his diary i thought i was learning to live; i was only learning to die", 
        "although the painting is barely begun the composition can be seen and it is very unusual", 
        "jerome as a penitent occupies the middle of the picture set on a slight diagonal and viewed somewhat from above", 
        "his kneeling form takes on a trapezoid shape with one arm stretched to the outer edge of the painting and his gaze looking in the opposite direction", 
        "j wasserman points out the link between this painting and leonardo s anatomical studies", 
        "across the foreground sprawls his symbol a great lion whose body and tail make a double spiral across the base of the picture space", 
        "the other remarkable feature is the sketchy landscape of craggy rocks against which the figure is silhouetted", 
        "the daring display of figure composition the landscape elements and personal drama also appear in the great unfinished masterpiece the adoration of the magi a commission from the monks of san donato a scopeto", 
        "it is a very complex composition about", 
        "leonardo did numerous drawings and preparatory studies including a detailed one in linear perspective of the ruined classical architecture which makes part of the backdrop to the scene", 
        "but in 1482 leonardo went off to milan at the behest of lorenzo de medici in order to win favour with ludovico il moro and the painting was abandoned", 
        "the third important work of this period is the virgin of the rocks which was commissioned in milan for the confraternity of the immaculate conception", 
        "the painting to be done with the assistance of the de predis brothers was to fill a large complex altarpiece already constructed", 
        "leonardo chose to paint an apocryphal moment of the infancy of christ when the infant john the baptist in protection of an angel met the holy family on the road to egypt", 
        "in this scene as painted by leonardo john recognizes and worships jesus as the christ", 
        "the painting demonstrates an eerie beauty as the graceful figures kneel in adoration around the infant christ in a wild landscape of tumbling rock and whirling water", 
        "while the painting is quite large about it is not nearly as complex as the painting ordered by the monks of st donato having only four figures rather than about fifty and a rocky landscape rather than architectural details", 
        "the painting was eventually finished; in fact two versions of the painting were finished one which remained at the chapel of the confraternity and the other which leonardo carried away to france", 
        "but the brothers did not get their painting or the de predis their payment until the next century", 
        "the last supper 1498 convent of sta", 
        "maria delle grazie milan italy leonardo s most famous painting of the 1490s is the last supper also painted in milan", 
        "the painting represents the last meal shared by jesus with his disciples before his capture and death", 
        "it shows specifically the moment when jesus has said one of you will betray me", 
        "leonardo tells the story of the consternation that this statement caused to the twelve followers of jesus", 
        "the novelist matteo bandello observed leonardo at work and wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and then not paint for three or four days at a time", 
        "this according to vasari was beyond the comprehension of the prior who hounded him until leonardo asked ludovico to intervene", 
        "vasari describes how leonardo troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of christ and the traitor judas told the duke that he might be obliged to use the prior as his model", 
        "when finished the painting was acclaimed as a masterpiece of design and characterisation but it deteriorated rapidly so that within a hundred years it was described by one viewer as completely ruined", 
        "leonardo instead of using the reliable technique of fresco had used tempera over a ground that was mainly gesso resulting in a surface which was subject to mold and to flaking", 
        "despite this the painting has remained one of the most reproduced works of art countless copies being made in every medium from carpets to cameos", 
        "mona lisa or la gioconda 1503 1505 1507 louvre paris france among the works created by leonardo in the 1500s is the small portrait known as the mona lisa or la gioconda the laughing one", 
        "the painting is famous in particular for the elusive smile on the woman s face its mysterious quality brought about perhaps by the fact that the artist has subtly shadowed the corners of the mouth and eyes so that the exact nature of the smile cannot be determined", 
        "the shadowy quality for which the work is renowned came to be called sfumato or leonardo s smoke", 
        "vasari who is generally thought to have known the painting only by repute said that the smile was so pleasing that it seemed divine rather than human; and those who saw it were amazed to find that it was as alive as the original", 
        "other characteristics found in this work are the unadorned dress in which the eyes and hands have no competition from other details the dramatic landscape background in which the world seems to be in a state of flux the subdued colouring and the extremely smooth nature of the painterly technique employing oils but laid on much like tempera and blended on the surface so that the brushstrokes are indistinguishable", 
        "vasari expressed the opinion that the manner of painting would make even the most confident master despair and lose heart", 
        "the perfect state of preservation and the fact that there is no sign of repair or overpainting is extremely rare in a panel painting of this date", 
        "in the virgin and child with st anne see below the composition again picks up the theme of figures in a landscape which wasserman describes as breathtakingly beautiful and harks back to the st jerome picture with the figure set at an oblique angle", 
        "what makes this painting unusual is that there are two obliquely set figures superimposed", 
        "mary is seated on the knee of her mother st anne", 
        "she leans forward to restrain the christ child as he plays roughly with a lamb the sign of his own impending sacrifice", 
        "this painting which was copied many times was to influence michelangelo raphael and andrea del sarto and through them pontormo and correggio", 
        "the trends in composition were adopted in particular by the venetian painters tintoretto and veronese", 
        "the virgin and child with st anne and st john the baptist c 1499 1500 national gallery london leonardo was not a prolific painter but he was a most prolific draftsman keeping journals full of small sketches and detailed drawings recording all manner of things that took his attention", 
        "as well as the journals there exist many studies for paintings some of which can be identified as preparatory to particular works such as the adoration of the magi the virgin of the rocks and the last supper", 
        "his earliest dated drawing is a landscape of the arno valley 1473 which shows the river the mountains montelupo castle and the farmlands beyond it in great detail", 
        "among his famous drawings are the vitruvian man a study of the proportions of the human body the head of an angel for the virgin of the rocks in the louvre a botanical study of star of bethlehem and a large drawing 160\u00d7100 cm in black chalk on coloured paper of the the virgin and child with st anne and st john the baptist in the national gallery london", 
        "this drawing employs the subtle sfumato technique of shading in the manner of the mona lisa", 
        "it is thought that leonardo never made a painting from it the closest similarity being to the virgin and child with st anne in the louvre", 
        "other drawings of interest include numerous studies generally referred to as caricatures because although exaggerated they appear to be based upon observation of live models", 
        "vasari relates that if leonardo saw a person with an interesting face he would follow them around all day observing them", 
        "there are numerous studies of beautiful young men often associated with salai with the rare and much admired facial feature the so called grecian profile", 
        "the grecian profile has a continuous straight line from forehead to nose tip the bridge of the nose being exceptionally high", 
        "it is a feature of many classical greek statues", 
        "these faces are often contrasted with that of a warrior", 
        "salai is often depicted in fancy dress costume", 
        "leonardo is known to have designed sets for pageants with which these may be associated", 
        "other often meticulous drawings show studies of drapery", 
        "a marked development in leonardo s ability to draw drapery occurred in his early works", 
        "another often reproduced drawing is a macabre sketch that was done by leonardo in florence in 1479 showing the body of bernardo baroncelli hanged in connection with the murder of giuliano brother of lorenzo de medici in the pazzi conspiracy", 
        "with dispassionate integrity leonardo has registered in neat mirror writing the colours of the robes that baroncelli was wearing when he died", 
        "the vitruvian man c 1485 accademia venice renaissance humanism saw no mutually exclusive polarities between the sciences and the arts and leonardo s studies in science and engineering are as impressive and innovative as his artistic work recorded in notebooks comprising some 13 000 pages of notes and drawings which fuse art and natural philosophy the forerunner of modern science", 
        "these notes were made and maintained daily throughout leonardo s life and travels as he made continual observations of the world around him", 
        "the journals are mostly written in mirror image cursive", 
        "the reason may have been more a practical expediency than for reasons of secrecy as is often suggested", 
        "since leonardo wrote with his left hand it is probable that it was easier for him to write from right to left", 
        "left handed writers using a split nib or quill pen experience difficulty pushing the pen from left to right across the page", 
        "his notes and drawings display an enormous range of interests and preoccupations some as mundane as lists of groceries and people who owed him money and some as intriguing as designs for wings and shoes for walking on water", 
        "there are compositions for paintings studies of details and drapery studies of faces and emotions of animals babies dissections plant studies rock formations whirl pools war machines helicopters and architecture", 
        "these notebooks originally loose papers of different types and sizes distributed by friends after his death have found their way into major collections such as the royal library at windsor castle the louvre the biblioteca nacional de espana the victoria and albert museum the biblioteca ambrosiana in milan which holds the twelve volume codex atlanticus and british library in london which has put a selection from its notebook bl arundel ms 263 online", 
        "the codex leicester is the only major scientific work of leonardo s in private hands", 
        "it is owned by bill gates and is displayed once a year in different cities around the world", 
        "leonardo s journals appear to have been intended for publication because many of the sheets have a form and order that would facilitate this", 
        "in many cases a single topic for example the heart or the human foetus is covered in detail in both words and pictures on a single sheet", 
        "this method of organisation minimises of loss of data in the case of pages being mixed up or destroyed", 
        "why they were not published within leonardo s lifetime is unknown", 
        "rhombicuboctahedron as published in pacioli s de divina proportione leonardo s approach to science was an observational one he tried to understand a phenomenon by describing and depicting it in utmost detail and did not emphasize experiments or theoretical explanation", 
        "since he lacked formal education in latin and mathematics contemporary scholars mostly ignored leonardo the scientist although he did teach himself latin", 
        "in the 1490s he studied mathematics under luca pacioli and prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates for pacioli s book de divina proportione published in 1509", 
        "it appears that from the content of his journals he was planning a series of treatises to be published on a variety of subjects", 
        "a coherent treatise on anatomy was said to have been observed during a visit by cardinal louis d aragon s secretary in 1517", 
        "aspects of his work on the studies of anatomy light and the landscape were assembled for publication by his pupil francesco melzi and eventually published as treatise on painting by leonardo da vinci in france and italy in 1651 and germany in 1724 with engravings based upon drawings by the classical painter nicholas poussin", 
        "according to arasse the treatise which in france went into sixty two editions in fifty years caused leonardo to be seen as the precursor of french academic thought on art", 
        "a recent and exhaustive analysis of leonardo as scientist by frtijof capra argues that leonardo was a fundamentally different kind of scientist from galileo newton and other scientists who followed him", 
        "leonardo s experimentation followed clear scientific method approaches and his theorising and hypothesising integrated the arts and particularly painting; these and leonardo s unique integrated holistic views of science make him a forerunner of modern systems theory and complexity schools of thought", 
        "anatomical study of the arm c 1510 leonardo s formal training in the anatomy of the human body began with his apprenticeship to andrea del verrocchio his teacher insisting that all his pupils learn anatomy", 
        "as an artist he quickly became master of topographic anatomy drawing many studies of muscles tendons and other visible anatomical features",

        "the report assumes that the violent reaction of lobsters to boiling water is a reflex to noxious stimuli", 
        "however review by the scottish animal rights group advocate for animals released the same year reported scientific evidence strongly suggests that there is a potential for lobsters to experience pain and suffering primarily because lobsters and other decapod crustaceans have opioid receptors and respond to opioids analgesics such as morphine in a similar way to vertebrates indicating that lobsters reaction to injury changes in the presence of painkillers", 
        "the similarities in lobsters and vertebrates stress systems and behavioral responses to noxious stimuli were given as additional evidence", 
        "a 2007 study at queen s university belfast suggested that crustaceans do feel pain", 
        "in the experiment when prawn antennae were rubbed with sodium hydroxide or acetic acid the animals showed increased grooming of the afflicted area and rubbed it more against the side of the tank", 
        "moreover this reaction was inhibited by a local anesthetic even though control prawns treated with only anesthetic did not show reduced activity", 
        "professor robert elwood who headed the study argues that sensing pain is crucial to prawn survival because it encourages them to avoid damaging behaviors", 
        "some scientists responded saying the rubbing may reflect an attempt to clean the affected area", 
        "in a 2009 study prof elwood and mirjam appel showed that hermit crabs make motivational tradeoffs between shocks and the quality of the shells they inhabit", 
        "in particular as crabs are shocked more intensely they become increasingly willing to leave their current shells for new shells and they spend less time deciding whether to enter those new shells", 
        "moreover because the researchers did not offer the new shells until after the electrical stimulation had ended the behavior change resulted from memory of the noxious event not an immediate reflex", 
        "alt photo of abstract lobster sculpture in vertebrates endogenous opioids are neurochemicals that moderate pain by interacting with opiate receptors", 
        "opioid peptides and opiate receptors occur naturally in crustaceans and although the norwegian scientific committee for food safety claims that at present no certain conclusion can be drawn critics interpret their presence as an indication that lobsters experience pain the aforementioned scottish paper holds that vertebrates and lobsters opioids may mediate pain in the same way", 
        "morphine an analgesic and naloxone an opioid receptor antagonist may affect a related species of crustacean chasmagnathus granulatus in much the same way they affect vertebrates injections of morphine into crabs produced a dose dependent reduction of their defensive response to an electric shock",

        "these findings have been replicated for other invertebrate species but similar data is not yet available for lobsters",

    "lyre": [
        "lyre the lyre is a stringed musical instrument well known for its use in classical antiquity and later", 
        "the recitations of the ancient greeks were accompanied by lyre playing", 
        "the lyre of classical antiquity was ordinarily played by being strummed with a plectrum like a guitar or a zither rather than being plucked like a harp", 
        "the fingers of the free hand silenced the unwanted strings in the chord", 
        "lyres from various times and places are regarded by some organologists specialists in the history of musical instruments as a branch of the zither family a general category which includes many different stringed instruments such as lutes guitars kantele and psalteries not just zithers", 
        "others view the lyre and zither as being two separate classes", 
        "those specialists maintain that the zither is distinguished by strings spread across all or most of its soundboard or the top surface of its sound chest also called soundbox or resonator as opposed to the lyre whose strings emanate from a more or less common point off the soundboard such as a tailpiece", 
        "examples of that difference include a piano a keyed zither and a violin referred to by some as a species of fingerboard lyre", 
        "some specialists even argue that instruments such as the violin and guitar belong to a class apart from the lyre because they have no yokes or uprights surmounting their resonators as true lyres have", 
        "this group they usually refer to as the lute class after the instrument of that name and include within it the guitar the violin the banjo and similar stringed instruments with fingerboards", 
        "those who differ with that opinion counter by calling the lute violin guitar banjo and other such instruments independent fingerboard lyres as opposed to simply fingerboard lyres such as the welsh crwth which have both fingerboards and frameworks above their resonators", 
        "one point on which organologists universally agree is that the distinction between harps on the one hand and zithers and lyres and in some views lutes on the other is that harps have strings emanating directly from the soundboard and residing in a plane that is basically perpendicular to the soundboard as opposed to the other instruments whose strings are attached to one or more points somewhere off the soundboard e g wrest pins on a zither tailpiece on a lyre or lute and lie in a plane essentially parallel to it", 
        "they also agree that neither the overall size of the instrument nor the number of strings on it have anything to do with its classification", 
        "for example small scottish and irish harps can be held on the lap while some ancient sumerian lyres appear to have been as tall as a seated man see kinsky; also sachs history under references", 
        "regarding the number of strings the standard 88 key piano has many more strings than even the largest harp", 
        "women posing as a siren with a lyre in 1913", 
        "a classical lyre has a hollow body or sound chest also known as soundbox or resonator", 
        "extending from this sound chest are two raised arms which are sometimes hollow and are curved both outward and forward", 
        "they are connected near the top by a crossbar or yoke", 
        "an additional crossbar fixed to the sound chest forms the bridge which transmits the vibrations of the strings", 
        "the deepest note was that farthest from the player s body; as the strings did not differ much in length more weight may have been gained for the deeper notes by thicker strings as in the violin and similar modern instruments or they were tuned by having a slacker tension", 
        "the strings were of gut", 
        "they were stretched between the yoke and bridge or to a tailpiece below the bridge", 
        "there were two ways of tuning one was to fasten the strings to pegs which might be turned; the other was to change the place of the string upon the crossbar; probably both expedients were used simultaneously", 
        "statue of the olympian deity apollo holding a lyre", 
        "according to ancient greek mythology the young god hermes created the lyre from a slaughtered cow from apollo s sacred herd using the intestines for the strings", 
        "lyres were associated with apollonian virtues of moderation and equilibrium contrasting with the dionysian pipes and aulos both of which represented ecstasy and celebration", 
        "locales in southern europe western asia or north africa have been proposed as the historic birthplace of the genus", 
        "the instrument is still played in north eastern parts of africa", 
        "some of the cultures using and developing the lyre were the aeolian and ionian greek colonies on the coasts of asia ancient asia minor modern day turkey bordering the lydian empire", 
        "some mythic masters like orpheus musaeus and thamyris were believed to have been born in thrace another place of extensive greek colonization", 
        "the name kissar kithara given by the ancient greeks to egyptian box instruments reveals the apparent similarities recognized by greeks themselves", 
        "the cultural peak of ancient egypt and thus the possible age of the earliest instruments of this type predates the 5th century classic greece", 
        "this indicates the possibility that the lyre might have existed in one of greece s neighboring countries either thrace lydia or egypt and was introduced into greece at pre classic times", 
        "the number of strings on the classical lyre varied at different epochs and possibly in different localities four seven and ten having been favorite numbers", 
        "they were used without a fingerboard no greek description or representation having ever been met with that can be construed as referring to one", 
        "nor was a bow possible the flat sound board being an insuperable impediment", 
        "the plectrum however was in constant use", 
        "it was held in the right hand to set the upper strings in vibration; when not in use it hung from the instrument by a ribbon", 
        "the fingers of the left hand touched the lower strings presumably to silence those whose notes were not wanted", 
        "there is no evidence as to the stringing of the greek lyre in the heroic age", 
        "plutarch says that olympus and terpander used but three strings to accompany their recitation", 
        "as the four strings led to seven and eight by doubling the tetrachord so the trichord is connected with the hexachord or six stringed lyre depicted on so many archaic greek vases", 
        "the accuracy of this representation cannot be insisted upon the vase painters being little mindful of the complete expression of details; yet one may suppose their tendency would be rather to imitate than to invent a number", 
        "it was their constant practice to represent the strings as being damped by the fingers of the left hand of the player after having been struck by the plectrum which he held in the right hand", 
        "before greek civilization had assumed its historic form there was likely to have been great freedom and independence of different localities in the matter of lyre stringing which is corroborated by the antique use of the chromatic half tone and enharmonic quarter tone tunings pointing to an early exuberance and perhaps also to an asiatic bias towards refinements of intonation", 
        "while the lyre is no longer played in modern greece the term lyra lives on as the name shared by various regional types of fiddles bowed lutes found throughout the country", 
        "there are two basic styles of lyra fiddles 1 a pear shaped instrument with a vaulted back which is found in the greek islands in particular the dodecanese and crete and the northern mainland regions of macedonia and thrace; and 2 an instrument with a narrow rectangular cylinder body of the pontic greeks who trace their roots to pontos pontus the black sea region of northern turkey", 
        "the pontic greek lyra is also known as kemenche", 
        "both types of lyra typically have three strings", 
        "they are held vertically upright and bowed horizontally; if the player is seated the instrument s base rests on the player s upper left thigh", 
        "the cretan lyra is traditionally played in a duo with the laouto a long neck fretted lute that is strummed like a guitar", 
        "reproduction of the lyre from the royal burial at sutton hoo late 6th early 7th century ad other instruments known as lyres have been fashioned and used in europe outside the greco roman world since at least the early middle ages and one view holds that many modern stringed instruments are late emerging examples of the lyre class", 
        "there is no clear evidence that non greco roman lyres were played exclusively with plectra and numerous instruments regarded by some as modern lyres are played with bows", 
        "lyres appearing to have emerged independently of greco roman prototypes were used by the teutonic gallic scandinavian and celtic peoples over a thousand years ago", 
        "dates of origin which probably vary from region to region cannot be determined but the oldest known fragments of such instruments are thought to date from around the sixth century of the common era", 
        "after the bow made its way into europe from the middle east around two centuries later it was applied to several species of those lyres that were small enough to make bowing practical", 
        "there came to be two broad classes of bowed european yoke lyres those with fingerboards dividing the open space within the yoke longitudinally and those without fingerboards", 
        "the last surviving examples of instruments within the latter class were the scandinavian talharpa and jouhikko", 
        "different tones could be obtained from a single bowed string by pressing the fingernails of the player s left hand against various points along the string to fret the string", 
        "the last of the bowed yoke lyres with fingerboard was the modern ca", 
        "1485 ca", 
        "1800 welsh crwth", 
        "it had several predecessors both in the british isles and in continental europe", 
        "pitch was changed on individual strings by pressing the string firmly against the fingerboard with the fingertips", 
        "like a violin this method shortened the vibrating length of the string to produce higher tones while releasing the finger gave the string a greater vibrating length thereby producing a tone lower in pitch", 
        "this is the principle on which the modern violin and guitar work", 
        "while the dates of origin and other evolutionary details of the european bowed yoke lyres continue to be disputed among organologists there is general agreement that none of them were the ancestors of modern orchestral bowed stringed instruments as once was thought", 
        "in furniture design a lyre arm is a wooden lyre shaped element often used at the front of the arm of a chair typically created as an exposed wooden part of a chair sofa or other furniture piece",

        "michelangelo transformed the plan the western end being finished to michelangelo s design the dome being completed after his death with some modification", 
        "in a demonstration of michelangelo s unique standing he was the first western artist whose biography was published while he was alive", 
        "two biographies were published of him during his lifetime; one of them by giorgio vasari proposed that he was the pinnacle of all artistic achievement since the beginning of the renaissance a viewpoint that continued to have currency in art history for centuries", 
        "in his lifetime he was also often called il divino the divine one", 
        "one of the qualities most admired by his contemporaries was his terribilita a sense of awe inspiring grandeur and it was the attempts of subsequent artists to imitate michelangelo s impassioned and highly personal style that resulted in mannerism the next major movement in western art after the high renaissance", 
        "michelangelo was born on 6 march 1475 in caprese near arezzo tuscany", 
        "his family had for several generations been small scale bankers in florence but his father lodovico di leonardo di buonarroti di simoni failed to maintain the bank s financial status and held occasional government positions", 
        "at the time of michelangelo s birth his father was the judicial administrator of the small town of caprese and local administrator of chiusi", 
        "michelangelo s mother was francesca di neri del miniato di siena", 
        "the buonarrotis claimed to descend from the countess mathilde of canossa; this claim remains unproven but michelangelo himself believed it", 
        "several months after michelangelo s birth the family returned to florence where michelangelo was raised", 
        "at later times during the prolonged illness and after the death of his mother when he was seven years old michelangelo lived with a stonecutter and his wife and family in the town of settignano where his father owned a marble quarry and a small farm", 
        "giorgio vasari quotes michelangelo as saying if there is some good in me it is because i was born in the subtle atmosphere of your country of arezzo", 
        "along with the milk of my nurse i received the knack of handling chisel and hammer with which i make my figures", 
        "michelangelo s father sent him to study grammar with the humanist francesco da urbino in florence as a young boy", 
        "the young artist however showed no interest in his schooling preferring to copy paintings from churches and seek the company of painters", 
        "at thirteen michelangelo was apprenticed to the painter domenico ghirlandaio", 
        "when michelangelo was only fourteen his father persuaded ghirlandaio to pay his apprentice as an artist which was highly unusual at the time", 
        "when in 1489 lorenzo de medici de facto ruler of florence asked ghirlandaio for his two best pupils ghirlandaio sent michelangelo and francesco granacci", 
        "from 1490 to 1492 michelangelo attended the humanist academy which the medici had founded along neo platonic lines", 
        "michelangelo studied sculpture under bertoldo di giovanni", 
        "at the academy both michelangelo s outlook and his art were subject to the influence of many of the most prominent philosophers and writers of the day including marsilio ficino pico della mirandola and angelo poliziano", 
        "at this time michelangelo sculpted the reliefs madonna of the steps 1490 1492 and battle of the centaurs 1491 1492", 
        "the latter was based on a theme suggested by poliziano and was commissioned by lorenzo de medici", 
        "while both were apprenticed to bertoldo di giovanni pietro torrigiano struck the 17 year old on the nose and thus caused that disfigurement which is so conspicuous in all the portraits of michelangelo", 
        "lorenzo de medici s death on 8 april 1492 brought a reversal of michelangelo s circumstances", 
        "michelangelo left the security of the medici court and returned to his father s house", 
        "in the following months he carved a wooden crucifix 1493 as a gift to the prior of the florentine church of santo spirito who had permitted him some studies of anatomy on the corpses of the church s hospital", 
        "between 1493 and 1494 he bought a block of marble for a larger than life statue of hercules which was sent to france and subsequently disappeared sometime circa 1700s on 20 january 1494 after heavy snowfalls lorenzo s heir piero de medici commissioned a snow statue and michelangelo again entered the court of the medici", 
        "in the same year the medici were expelled from florence as the result of the rise of savonarola", 
        "michelangelo left the city before the end of the political upheaval moving to venice and then to bologna", 
        "in bologna he was commissioned to finish the carving of the last small figures of the shrine of st dominic in the church dedicated to that saint", 
        "towards the end 1494 the political situation in florence was calmer", 
        "the city previously under threat from the french was no longer in danger as charles viii had suffered defeats", 
        "michelangelo returned to florence but received no commissions from the new city government under savonarola", 
        "he returned to the employment of the medici", 
        "during the half year he spent in florence he worked on two small statues a child st john the baptist and a sleeping cupid", 
        "according to condivi lorenzo di pierfrancesco de medici for whom michelangelo had sculpted st john the baptist asked that michelangelo fix it so that it looked as if it had been buried so he could send it to romepass it off as an ancient work andsell it much better", 
        "both lorenzo and michelangelo were unwittingly cheated out of the real value of the piece by a middleman", 
        "cardinal raffaele riario to whom lorenzo had sold it discovered that it was a fraud but was so impressed by the quality of the sculpture that he invited the artist to rome", 
        "this apparent success in selling his sculpture abroad as well as the conservative florentine situation may have encouraged michelangelo to accept the prelate s invitation", 
        "michelangelo s pieta a depiction of the body of jesus on the lap of his mother mary after the crucifixion was carved in 1499 when the sculptor was 24 years old", 
        "michelangelo arrived in rome 25 june 1496 at the age of 21", 
        "on 4 july of the same year he began work on a commission for cardinal raffaele riario an over life size statue of the roman wine god bacchus", 
        "however upon completion the work was rejected by the cardinal and subsequently entered the collection of the banker jacopo galli for his garden", 
        "in november of 1497 the french ambassador in the holy see commissioned one of his most famous works the pieta and the contract was agreed upon in august of the following year", 
        "the contemporary opinion about this work a revelation of all the potentialities and force of the art of sculpture was summarized by vasari it is certainly a miracle that a formless block of stone could ever have been reduced to a perfection that nature is scarcely able to create in the flesh", 
        "in rome michelangelo lived near the church of santa maria di loreto", 
        "here according to the legend he fell in love with vittoria colonna marquise of pescara and a poet", 
        "his house was demolished in 1874 and the remaining architectural elements saved by the new proprietors were destroyed in 1930", 
        "today a modern reconstruction of michelangelo s house can be seen on the gianicolo hill", 
        "it is also during this period that skeptics allege michelangelo executed the sculpture laocoon and his sons which resides in the vatican catterson lynn", 
        "the statue of david completed by michelangelo in 1504 is one of the most renowned works of the renaissance", 
        "michelangelo returned to florence in 1499 1501", 
        "things were changing in the republic after the fall of anti renaissance priest and leader of florence girolamo savonarola executed in 1498 and the rise of the gonfaloniere pier soderini", 
        "he was asked by the consuls of the guild of wool to complete an unfinished project begun 40 years earlier by agostino di duccio a colossal statue portraying david as a symbol of florentine freedom to be placed in the piazza della signoria in front of the palazzo vecchio", 
        "michelangelo responded by completing his most famous work the statue of david in 1504", 
        "this masterwork created out of a marble block from the quarries at carrara that had already been worked on by an earlier hand definitively established his prominence as a sculptor of extraordinary technical skill and strength of symbolic imagination", 
        "also during this period michelangelo painted the holy family and st john also known as the doni tondo or the holy family of the tribune it was commissioned for the marriage of angelo doni and maddalena strozzi and in the 17th century hung in the room known as the tribune in the uffizi", 
        "he also may have painted the madonna and child with john the baptist known as the manchester madonna and now in the national gallery london", 
        "michelangelo painted the ceiling of the sistine chapel; the work took approximately four years to complete 1508 1512 in 1505 michelangelo was invited back to rome by the newly elected pope julius ii", 
        "he was commissioned to build the pope s tomb", 
        "under the patronage of the pope michelangelo had to constantly stop work on the tomb in order to accomplish numerous other tasks", 
        "because of these interruptions michelangelo worked on the tomb for 40 years", 
        "the tomb of which the central feature is michelangelo s statue of moses was never finished to michelangelo s satisfaction", 
        "it is located in the church of s pietro in vincoli in rome", 
        "during the same period michelangelo took the commission to paint the ceiling of the sistine chapel which took approximately four years to complete 1508 1512", 
        "according to michelangelo s account bramante and raphael convinced the pope to commission michelangelo in a medium not familiar to the artist", 
        "this was done in order that he michelangelo would suffer unfavorable comparisons with his rival raphael who at the time was at the peak of his own artistry as the primo fresco painter", 
        "however this story is discounted by modern historians on the grounds of contemporary evidence and may merely have been a reflection of the artist s own perspective", 
        "michelangelo was originally commissioned to paint the 12 apostles against a starry sky but lobbied for a different and more complex scheme representing creation the downfall of man and the promise of salvation through the prophets and genealogy of christ", 
        "the work is part of a larger scheme of decoration within the chapel which represents much of the doctrine of the catholic church the composition eventually contained over 300 figures and had at its center nine episodes from the book of genesis divided into three groups god s creation of the earth; god s creation of humankind and their fall from god s grace; and lastly the state of humanity as represented by noah and his family", 
        "on the pendentives supporting the ceiling are painted twelve men and women who prophesied the coming of the jesus", 
        "they are seven prophets of israel and five sibyls prophetic women of the classical world", 
        "among the most famous paintings on the ceiling are the creation of adam adam and eve in the garden of eden the great flood the prophet isaiah and the cumaean sibyl", 
        "around the windows are painted the ancestors of christ", 
        "michelangelo s moses centre with rachel and leah on his sides", 
        "in 1513 pope julius ii died and his successor pope leo x a medici commissioned michelangelo to reconstruct the facade of the basilica of san lorenzo in florence and to adorn it with sculptures", 
        "michelangelo agreed reluctantly", 
        "the three years he spent in creating drawings and models for the facade as well as attempting to open a new marble quarry at pietrasanta specifically for the project were among the most frustrating in his career as work was abruptly cancelled by his financially strapped patrons before any real progress had been made", 
        "the basilica lacks a facade to this day", 
        "apparently not the least embarrassed by this turnabout the medici later came back to michelangelo with another grand proposal this time for a family funerary chapel in the basilica of san lorenzo", 
        "fortunately for posterity this project occupying the artist for much of the 1520s and 1530s was more fully realized", 
        "though still incomplete it is the best example we have of the integration of the artist s sculptural and architectural vision since michelangelo created both the major sculptures as well as the interior plan", 
        "ironically the most prominent tombs are those of two rather obscure medici who died young a son and grandson of lorenzo", 
        "il magnifico himself is buried in an unfinished and comparatively unimpressive tomb on one of the side walls of the chapel not given a free standing monument as originally intended", 
        "michelangelo s the last judgment", 
        "saint bartholomew is shown holding the knife of his martyrdom and his flayed skin", 
        "the face of the skin is recognizable as michelangelo", 
        "in 1527 the florentine citizens encouraged by the sack of rome threw out the medici and restored the republic", 
        "a siege of the city ensued and michelangelo went to the aid of his beloved florence by working on the city s fortifications from 1528 to 1529", 
        "the city fell in 1530 and the medici were restored to power", 
        "completely out of sympathy with the repressive reign of the ducal medici michelangelo left florence for good in the mid 1530s leaving assistants to complete the medici chapel", 
        "years later his body was brought back from rome for interment at the basilica di santa croce fulfilling the maestro s last request to be buried in his beloved tuscany", 
        "the fresco of the last judgment on the altar wall of the sistine chapel was commissioned by pope clement vii who died shortly after assigning the commission", 
        "paul iii was instrumental in seeing that michelangelo began and completed the project", 
        "michelangelo labored on the project from 1534 to october 1541", 
        "the work is massive and spans the entire wall behind the altar of the sistine chapel", 
        "the last judgment is a depiction of the second coming of christ and the apocalypse; where the souls of humanity rise and are assigned to their various fates as judged by christ surrounded by the saints", 
        "once completed the depictions of nakedness in the papal chapel was considered obscene and sacrilegious and cardinal carafa and monsignor sernini mantua s ambassador campaigned to have the fresco removed or censored but the pope resisted", 
        "after michelangelo s death it was decided to obscure the genitals pictura in cappella ap ca coopriantur", 
        "so daniele da volterra an apprentice of michelangelo was commissioned to cover with perizomas briefs the genitals leaving unaltered the complex of bodies", 
        "when the work was restored in 1993 the conservators chose not to remove all the perizomas of daniele leaving some of them as a historical document and because some of michelangelo s work was previously scraped away by the touch up artist s application of decency to the masterpiece", 
        "a faithful uncensored copy of the original by marcello venusti can be seen at the capodimonte museum of naples", 
        "michelangelo designed the dome of st peter s basilica although it was unfinished when he died", 
        "censorship always followed michelangelo once described as inventor delle porcherie inventor of obscenities in the original italian language referring to pork things", 
        "the infamous fig leaf campaign of the counter reformation aiming to cover all representations of human genitals in paintings and sculptures started with michelangelo s works", 
        "to give two examples the marble statue of cristo della minerva church of santa maria sopra minerva rome was covered by added drapery as it remains today and the statue of the naked child jesus in madonna of bruges the church of our lady in bruges belgium remained covered for several decades", 
        "also the plaster copy of the david in the cast courts victoria and albert museum in london has a fig leaf in a box at the back of the statue", 
        "it was there to be placed over the statue s genitals so that they would not upset visiting female royalty", 
        "in 1546 michelangelo was appointed architect of st peter s basilica in the vatican and designed its dome", 
        "as st peter s was progressing there was concern that michelangelo would pass away before the dome was finished", 
        "however once building commenced on the lower part of the dome the supporting ring the completion of the design was inevitable", 
        "on 7 december 2007 michelangelo s red chalk sketch for the dome of st peter s basilica his last before his 1564 death was discovered in the vatican archives",

        "michelangelo s own tomb at basilica di santa croce di firenze florence michelangelo worked on many projects that had been started by other men most notably in his work at st peter s basilica rome", 
        "the campidoglio designed by michelangelo during the same period rationalized the structures and spaces of rome s capitoline hill", 
        "its shape more a rhomboid than a square was intended to counteract the effects of perspective", 
        "the major florentine architectural projects by michelangelo are the unexecuted facade for the basilica of san lorenzo florence and the medici chapel capella medicea and laurentian library there and the fortifications of florence",

        "michelangelo who was often arrogant with others and constantly dissatisfied with himself saw art as originating from inner inspiration and from culture", 
        "in contradiction to the ideas of his rival leonardo da vinci michelangelo saw nature as an enemy that had to be overcome", 
        "the figures that he created are forceful and dynamic each in its own space apart from the outside world", 
        "for michelangelo the job of the sculptor was to free the forms that were already inside the stone", 
        "he believed that every stone had a sculpture within it and that the work of sculpting was simply a matter of chipping away all that was not a part of the statue", 
        "several anecdotes reveal that michelangelo s skill especially in sculpture was greatly admired in his own time", 
        "another lorenzo de medici wanted to use michelangelo to make some money", 
        "he had michelangelo sculpt a cupid that looked worn and old", 
        "lorenzo paid michelangelo 30 ducats but sold the cupid for 200 ducats", 
        "cardinal raffaele riario became suspicious and sent someone to investigate", 
        "the man had michelangelo do a sketch for him of a cupid and then told michelangelo that while he received 30 ducats for his cupid lorenzo had passed the cupid off for an antique and sold it for 200 ducats", 
        "michelangelo then confessed that he had done the cupid but had no idea that he had been cheated", 
        "after the truth was revealed the cardinal later took this as proof of his skill and commissioned his bacchus",

        "in his personal life michelangelo was abstemious", 
        "he told his apprentice ascanio condivi however rich i may have been i have always lived like a poor man", 
        "condivi said he was indifferent to food and drink eating more out of necessity than of pleasure and that he often slept in his clothes and boots", 
        "these habits may have made him unpopular", 
        "his biographer paolo giovio says his nature was so rough and uncouth that his domestic habits were incredibly squalid and deprived posterity of any pupils who might have followed him", 
        "he may not have minded since he was by nature a solitary and melancholy person", 
        "he had a reputation for being bizzarro e fantastico because he withdrew himself from the company of men", 
        "drawing for the libyan sybil new york city metropolitan museum of art the libyan sybil sistine chapel accomplished", 
        "fundamental to michelangelo s art is his love of male beauty which attracted him both aesthetically and emotionally", 
        "in part this was an expression of the renaissance idealization of masculinity", 
        "but in michelangelo s art there is clearly a sensual response to this aesthetic", 
        "the sculptor s expressions of love have been characterized as both neoplatonic and openly homoerotic; recent scholarship seeks an interpretation which respects both readings yet is wary of drawing absolute conclusions", 
        "one example of the conundrum is cecchino dei bracci whose death only a year after their meeting in 1543 inspired the writing of forty eight funeral epigrams which by some accounts allude to a relationship that was not only romantic but physical as well according to others they represent an emotionless and elegant re imagining of platonic dialogue whereby erotic poetry was seen as an expression of refined sensibilities indeed it must be remembered that professions of love in 16th century italy were given a far wider application than now", 
        "some young men were street wise and took advantage of the sculptor", 
        "febbo di poggio in 1532 peddled his charms in answer to michelangelo s love poem he asks for money",

        "some modern commentators assert that the relationship was merely a platonic affection even suggesting that michelangelo was seeking a surrogate son", 
        "the text goes so far as to claim a bit defensively these have naturally been interpreted as indications that michelangelo was a homosexual but such a reaction according to the artist s own statement would be that of the ignorant", 
        "however their homoerotic nature was recognized in his own time so that a decorous veil was drawn across them by his grand nephew michelangelo the younger who published an edition of the poetry in 1623 with the gender of pronouns changed",

        "cristofori s great success was in solving without any prior example the fundamental mechanical problem of piano design the hammer must strike the string but not remain in contact with it as a tangent remains in contact with a clavichord string because this would damp the sound", 
        "moreover the hammer must return to its rest position without bouncing violently and it must be possible to repeat a note rapidly", 
        "cristofori s piano action served as a model for the many different approaches to piano actions that followed", 
        "while cristofori s early instruments were made with thin strings and were much quieter than the modern piano compared to the clavichord the only previous keyboard instrument capable of minutely controlled dynamic nuance through the keyboard they were considerably louder and had more sustaining power",

        "in the period lasting from about 1790 to 1860 the mozart era piano underwent tremendous changes that led to the modern form of the instrument", 
        "this revolution was in response to a consistent preference by composers and pianists for a more powerful sustained piano sound and made possible by the ongoing industrial revolution with technological resources such as high quality steel called piano wire for strings and precision casting for the production of iron frames",

        "in 1821 sebastien erard invented the double escapement action which permitted a note to be repeated even if the key had not yet risen to its maximum vertical position", 
        "this facilitated rapid playing of repeated notes and this musical device was pioneered by liszt", 
        "when the invention became public as revised by henri herz the double escapement action gradually became standard in grand pianos and is still incorporated into all grand pianos currently produced", 
        "one of the major technical innovations that helped to create the sound of the modern piano was the use of a strong iron frame", 
        "also called the plate the iron frame sits atop the soundboard and serves as the primary bulwark against the force of string tension", 
        "the increased structural integrity of the iron frame allowed the use of thicker tenser and more numerous strings", 
        "in a modern grand the total string tension can exceed 20 tons", 
        "the single piece cast iron frame was patented in 1825 in boston by alpheus babcock combining the metal hitch pin plate 1821 claimed by broadwood on behalf of samuel herve and resisting bars thom and allen 1820 but also claimed by broadwood and erard", 
        "babcock later worked for the chickering mackays firm who patented the first full iron frame for grand pianos in 1843",

        "other innovations for the mechanism included the use of felt hammer coverings instead of layered leather hammers", 
        "felt hammers which were first introduced by henri pape in 1826 were a more consistent material permitting wider dynamic ranges as hammer weights and string tension increased", 
        "the sostenuto pedal see below invented in 1844 by jean louis boisselot and improved by the steinway firm in 1874 allowed a wider range of effects", 
        "other important technical innovations of this era included changes to the way the piano was strung such as the use of a choir of three strings rather than two for all but the lower notes and the use of different stringing methods", 
        "with the over strung scale also called cross stringing the strings are placed in a vertically overlapping slanted arrangement with two heights of bridges on the soundboard instead of just one",

        "improvements have been made in manufacturing processes and many individual details of the instrument continue to receive attention",

        "pianos with shorter thicker and stiffer strings e g baby grands have more inharmonicity", 
        "the longer strings on a concert grand can vibrate more freely than the shorter thicker strings on a baby grand which means that a concert grand s strings will have truer overtones", 
        "this is partly because the strings will be tuned closer to equal temperament in relation to the standard pitch with less stretching in the piano tuning see piano tuning", 
        "full size grands are usually used for public concerts whereas smaller grands introduced by sohmer co in 1884 are often chosen for domestic use where space and cost are considerations", 
        "upright piano upright pianos also called vertical pianos are more compact because the frame and strings are vertical", 
        "it is considered harder to produce a sensitive piano action when the hammers move horizontally as the vertical hammer return is dependent on springs which are prone to wear and tear", 
        "however a well regulated vertical piano will probably play more smoothly than a poorly regulated grand piano and the very best upright pianos approach the level of some grand pianos of the same size in tone quality and responsiveness", 
        "one noticeable advantage that the grand piano action has over the vertical action is that all grand pianos have a special repetition lever in the playing action that is absent in all verticals", 
        "this repetition lever a separate one for every key catches the hammer close to the strings as long as the keys are played repeatedly and fairly quickly", 
        "in this position with the hammer resting on the lever a pianist can play repeated notes staccato and trills with much more speed and control than is possible on a vertical piano",

        "a modern equivalent for the player piano is the yamaha disklavier system which uses solenoids and midi instead of pneumatics and rolls", 
        "silent pianos which allow a regular piano to be used converted to a digital instrument are a recent innovation and are becoming more popular", 
        "irving berlin played a special piano called the transposing piano which was invented in 1801 by edward ryley",

        "a relatively recent development is the prepared piano which is used in contemporary art music", 
        "a prepared piano is a standard grand piano which has had objects placed inside it before a performance in order to alter its sound or which has had its mechanism changed in some way", 
        "the scores for music for prepared piano often instruct the pianist to insert pieces of rubber or small pieces of metal screws or washers in between the strings", 
        "these added items either mute the strings or create unusual vibrating sounds", 
        "since the 1980s digital pianos have been available which use digital sampling technology to reproduce the sound of each piano note", 
        "the best digital pianos are sophisticated with features including working pedals weighted keys multiple voices and midi interfaces", 
        "however with such technology it is difficult to duplicate one particular aspect of acoustic pianos namely that when the damper pedal see below is depressed the strings not struck vibrate sympathetically when other strings are struck as well as the unique instrument specific mathematical non linearity of partials on any given unison", 
        "since this sympathetic vibration is considered central to piano tone many digital pianos do not sound the same as the best acoustic pianos", 
        "progress is being made in this area by including physical models of sympathetic vibration in the synthesis software", 
        "some higher end digital pianos such as the yamaha clavinova series or the kawai mp8 series produced in the last few years incorporate string resonance technology to overcome this limitation", 
        "with the advent of powerful desktop computers highly realistic sampled digital grand pianos have become available as affordable software modules",

        "some bosendorfer pianos extend the normal range downwards to f0 with one other model going as far as a bottom c0 making a full eight octave range", 
        "these extra keys are sometimes hidden under a small hinged lid that can be flipped down to cover the keys in order to avoid visual disorientation in a pianist unfamiliar with the extended keyboard", 
        "on others the colours of the extra white keys are reversed black instead of white", 
        "the extra keys are added primarily for increased resonance from the associated strings; that is they vibrate sympathetically with other strings whenever the damper pedal is depressed and thus give a fuller tone", 
        "only a very small number of works composed for piano actually use these notes", 
        "more recently the stuart and sons company has also manufactured extended range pianos",

        "it lifts the dampers from all keys sustaining all played notes and altering the overall tone", 
        "the soft pedal or una corda pedal is placed leftmost in the row of pedals", 
        "in grand pianos it shifts the entire action including the keyboard to the right so that the hammers hit only one of the three strings for each note hence the name una corda or one string", 
        "the effect is to soften the note as well as to change the tone", 
        "in uprights this action is not possible and so the pedal moves the hammers closer to the strings allowing the hammers to hit the strings with less kinetic energy to produce a softer sound", 
        "on grand pianos the middle pedal is a sostenuto pedal", 
        "this pedal keeps raised any damper that was already raised at the moment the pedal is depressed", 
        "this makes it possible to sustain some notes by depressing the sostenuto pedal before notes to be sustained are released while the player s hands are free to play other notes", 
        "this can be useful for musical passages with pedal points and other otherwise tricky or impossible situations", 
        "on many upright pianos there is a middle pedal called the practice or celeste pedal", 
        "this drops a piece of felt between the hammers and strings greatly muting the sounds", 
        "there are also non standard variants", 
        "on vertical pianos the middle pedal can be a bass sustain pedal that is when it is depressed the dampers lift off the strings only in the bass section", 
        "this pedal would be used only when a pianist needs to sustain a single bass note or chord over many measures while playing the melody in the treble section", 
        "on the largest fazioli piano there is a fourth pedal to the left of the principal three", 
        "this fourth pedal works in the same way as the soft pedal of an upright piano moving the hammers closer to the strings", 
        "an upright pedal piano the rare transposing piano of which irving berlin possessed an example had a middle pedal that functioned as a clutch which disengages the keyboard from the mechanism enabling the keyboard to be moved to the left or right with a lever", 
        "the entire action of the piano is thus shifted to allow the pianist to play music written in one key so that it sounds in a different key", 
        "the pedalier piano or pedal piano is a rare type of piano that includes a pedalboard enabling bass register notes to be played with the feet as is standard on the organ", 
        "there are two types of pedal piano the pedal board may be an integral part of the instrument using the same strings and mechanism as the manual keyboard or less frequently it may consist of two independent pianos each with its separate mechanics and strings which are placed one above the other a regular piano played by the hands and a bass register piano played by the feet", 
        "many parts of a piano are made of materials selected for sturdiness", 
        "in quality pianos the outer rim of the piano is made of a hardwood normally maple or beech", 
        "according to harold a conklin the purpose of a sturdy rim is so that the vibrational energy will stay as much as possible in the soundboard instead of dissipating uselessly in the case parts which are inefficient radiators of sound",

        "the rim is normally made by laminating flexible strips of hardwood to the desired shape a system that was developed by theodore steinway in 1880", 
        "the thick wooden braces at the bottom grands or back uprights of the piano are not as acoustically important as the rim and are often made of a softwood even in top quality pianos in order to save weight", 
        "the requirement of structural strength fulfilled with stout hardwood and thick metal makes a piano heavy; even a small upright can weigh 136 kg 300 lb and the steinway concert grand model d weighs 480 kg 990 lb", 
        "the largest piano built the fazioli f308 weighs 691 kg 1520 lb", 
        "the pinblock which holds the tuning pins in place is another area of the piano where toughness is important", 
        "it is made of hardwood often maple and generally is laminated built of multiple layers for additional strength and gripping power", 
        "piano strings also called piano wire which must endure years of extreme tension and hard blows are made of high quality steel", 
        "they are manufactured to vary as little as possible in diameter since all deviations from uniformity introduce tonal distortion", 
        "the bass strings of a piano are made of a steel core wrapped with copper wire to increase their mass whilst retaining flexibility", 
        "the plate or metal frame of a piano is usually made of cast iron", 
        "it is advantageous for the plate to be quite massive", 
        "since the strings are attached to the plate at one end any vibrations transmitted to the plate will result in loss of energy to the desired efficient channel of sound transmission namely the bridge and the soundboard", 
        "some manufacturers now use cast steel in their plates for greater strength", 
        "the casting of the plate is a delicate art since the dimensions are crucial and the iron shrinks by about one percent during cooling", 
        "the inclusion in a piano of an extremely large piece of metal is potentially an aesthetic handicap which piano makers overcome by polishing painting and decorating the plate", 
        "plates often include the manufacturer s ornamental medallion and can be strikingly attractive", 
        "in an effort to make pianos lighter alcoa worked with winter and company piano manufacturers to make pianos using an aluminum plate during the 1940s", 
        "the use of aluminum for piano plates however did not become widely accepted and was discontinued",

        "however since world war ii plastics have become available", 
        "early plastics were incorporated into some pianos in the late 1940s and 1950s but proved disastrous because they crystallized and lost their strength after only a few decades of use", 
        "the steinway firm once incorporated teflon a synthetic material developed by dupont for some grand action parts in place of cloth but ultimately abandoned the experiment due to an inherent clicking which invariably developed over time", 
        "also teflon is humidity stable whereas the wood adjacent to the teflon will swell and shrink with humidity changes causing problems",

        "spruce is chosen for its high ratio of strength to weight", 
        "the best piano makers use close grained quarter sawn defect free spruce and make sure that it has been carefully dried over a long period of time before making it into soundboards",

        "pierre auguste renoir was born in limoges haute vienne france the child of a working class family", 
        "as a boy he worked in a porcelain factory where his drawing talents led to him being chosen to paint designs on fine china", 
        "he also painted hangings for overseas missionaries and decorations on fans before he enrolled in art school",

        "there he met alfred sisley frederic bazille and claude monet", 
        "at times during the 1860s he did not have enough money to buy paint", 
        "although renoir first started exhibiting paintings at the paris salon in 1864 recognition did not come for another ten years due in part to the turmoil of the franco prussian war", 
        "during the paris commune in 1871 while he painted on the banks of the seine river some members of a commune group thought he was a spy and were about to throw him into the river when a commune leader raoul rigault recognized renoir as the man who had protected him on an earlier occasion", 
        "different and less life threatening versions are offered by paul valery and vollard", 
        "in all accounts however their re acquaintance led to great celebration", 
        "in 1874 a ten year friendship with jules le coeur and his family ended and renoir lost not only the valuable support gained by the association but a generous welcome to stay on their property near fontainebleau and its scenic forest", 
        "this loss of a favorite painting location resulted in a distinct change of subjects", 
        "renoir experienced his initial acclaim when six of his paintings hung in the first impressionist exhibition in 1874", 
        "in the same year two of his works were shown with durand ruel in london",

        "while living and working in montmartre renoir employed as a model suzanne valadon who posed for him the bathers 1885 87; dance at bougival 1883 and many of his fellow painters while studying their techniques; eventually she became one of the leading painters of the day", 
        "in 1887 a year when queen victoria celebrated her golden jubilee and upon the request of the queen s associate phillip richbourg he donated several paintings to the french impressionist paintings catalog as a token of his loyalty",

        "renoir painted during the last twenty years of his life even when arthritis severely limited his movement and he was wheelchair bound", 
        "he developed progressive deformities in his hands and ankylosis of his right shoulder requiring him to adapt his painting technique", 
        "it has often been reported that in the advanced stages of his arthritis he painted by having a brush strapped to his paralyzed fingers but this is erroneous; renoir remained able to grasp a brush although he required an assistant to place it in his hand", 
        "the wrapping of his hands with bandages apparent in late photographs of the artist served to prevent skin irritation", 
        "during this period he created sculptures by cooperating with a young artist richard guino who worked the clay",

        "in characteristic impressionist style renoir suggested the details of a scene through freely brushed touches of color so that his figures softly fuse with one another and their surroundings", 
        "his initial paintings show the influence of the colorism of eugene delacroix and the luminosity of camille corot", 
        "he also admired the realism of gustave courbet and edouard manet and his early work resembles theirs in his use of black as a color",

        "in the late 1860s through the practice of painting light and water en plein air in the open air he and his friend claude monet discovered that the color of shadows is not brown or black but the reflected color of the objects surrounding them",

        "it was a trip to italy in 1881 when he saw works by raphael and other renaissance masters that convinced him that he was on the wrong path and for the next several years he painted in a more severe style in an attempt to return to classicism", 
        "this is sometimes called his ingres period as he concentrated on his drawing and emphasized the outlines of figures", 
        "asked late in life if he felt an affinity to ingres he responded i should very much like to", 
        "after 1890 however he changed direction again returning to the use of thinly brushed color which dissolved outlines as in his earlier work", 
        "from this period onward he concentrated especially on monumental nudes and domestic scenes fine examples of which are girls at the piano 1892 and grandes baigneuses 1918 19",

        "the trumpet and trombone share a roughly cylindrical bore which results in a bright loud sound", 
        "the bore is actually a complex series of tapers smaller at the mouthpiece receiver and larger just before the flare of the bell begins; careful design of these tapers is critical to the intonation of the instrument", 
        "by comparison the cornet and flugelhorn have conical bores and produce a more mellow tone", 
        "as with all brass instruments sound is produced by blowing air through closed lips producing a buzzing sound into the mouthpiece and starting a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the trumpet", 
        "the player can select the pitch from a range of overtones or harmonics by changing the lip aperture and tension known as the embouchure", 
        "modern trumpets also have three piston valves each of which increases the length of tubing when engaged thereby lowering the pitch", 
        "the first valve lowers the instrument s pitch by a whole step 2 semitones the second valve by a half step 1 semitone and the third valve by one and a half steps 3 semitones", 
        "when a fourth valve is present as with some piccolo trumpets it lowers the pitch a perfect fourth 5 semitones",

        "the sound is projected outward via the bell", 
        "the trumpet s harmonic series is closely matched to the musical scale but there are some notes in the series which are a compromise and thus slightly off key; these are known as wolf tones", 
        "some trumpets have a slide mechanism built in to compensate", 
        "the mouthpiece has a circular rim which provides a comfortable environment for the lips vibration", 
        "directly behind the rim is the cup which channels the air into a much smaller opening the back bore or shank which tapers out slightly to match the diameter of the trumpet s lead pipe",

        "its slightly smaller size gives it a brighter more lively sound", 
        "because music written for early trumpets required the use of a different trumpet for each key they did not have valves and therefore were not chromatic and also because a player may choose to play a particular passage on a different trumpet from the one indicated on the written music orchestra trumpet players are generally adept at transposing music at sight sometimes playing music written for the b trumpet on the c trumpet and vice versa",

        "piccolo trumpets in g f and even c are also manufactured but are rarer", 
        "many players use a smaller mouthpiece on the piccolo trumpet which requires a different sound production technique from the b trumpet and can limit endurance", 
        "almost all piccolo trumpets have four valves instead of the usual three the fourth valve lowers the pitch usually by a fourth to facilitate the playing of lower notes",

        "tarr the historical slide trumpet was probably first developed in the late fourteenth century for use in alta capella wind bands", 
        "deriving from early straight trumpets the renaissance slide trumpet was essentially a natural trumpet with a sliding leadpipe", 
        "this single slide was rather awkward as the entire corpus of the instrument moved and the range of the slide was probably no more than a major third", 
        "originals were probably pitched in d to fit with shawms in d and g probably at a typical pitch standard near a 466", 
        "as no instruments from this period are known to survive the details and even the existence of a renaissance slide trumpet is a matter of some conjecture and there continues to be some debate among scholars", 
        "some slide trumpet designs saw use in england in the eighteenth century", 
        "the pocket trumpet is a compact b trumpet", 
        "the bell is usually smaller than a standard trumpet and the tubing is more tightly wound to reduce the instrument size without reducing the total tube length",

        "it can have a tone quality and projection unique in the trumpet world a warm sound and a voice like articulation", 
        "unfortunately since many pocket trumpet models suffer from poor design as well as cheap and sloppy manufacturing the intonation tone color and dynamic range of such instruments are severely hindered",

        "there are also rotary valve or german trumpets as well as alto and baroque trumpets", 
        "the trumpet is often confused with its close relative the cornet which has a more conical tubing shape compared to the trumpet s more cylindrical tube", 
        "this along with additional bends in the cornet s tubing gives the cornet a slightly mellower tone but the instruments are otherwise nearly identical", 
        "they have the same length of tubing and therefore the same pitch so music written for cornet and trumpet is interchangeable", 
        "another relative the flugelhorn has tubing that is even more conical than that of the cornet and an even richer tone", 
        "it is sometimes augmented with a fourth valve to improve the intonation of some lower notes", 
        "on any trumpet cornet or flugelhorn pressing the valves indicated by the numbers below will produce the written notes shown open means all valves up 1 means first valve 1 2 means first and second valve simultaneously and so on", 
        "the concert pitch which sounds depends on the transposition of the instrument", 
        "engaging the fourth valve if present drops any of these pitches by a perfect fourth as well", 
        "within each overtone series the different pitches are attained by changing the embouchure or lip position and firmness", 
        "standard fingerings above high c are the same as for the notes an octave below c is 1 2 d is 1 etc", 
        "a step a tone; a half step a semitone note that the fundamental of each overtone series does not exist the series begins with the first overtone", 
        "notes in parentheses are the sixth overtone representing a pitch with a frequency of seven times that of the fundamental; while this pitch is close to the note shown it is slightly flat relative to equal temperament and use of those fingerings is generally avoided", 
        "the fingering schema arises from the length of each valve s tubing a longer tube produces a lower pitch", 
        "valve 1 increases the tubing length enough to lower the pitch by one whole step valve 2 by one half step and valve 3 by one and a half steps", 
        "this scheme and the nature of the overtone series create the possibility of alternate fingerings for certain notes", 
        "for example third space c can be produced with no valves engaged standard fingering or with valves 2 3", 
        "also any note produced with 1 2 as its standard fingering can also be produced with valve 3 each drops the pitch by 1 1 2 steps", 
        "alternate fingerings may be used to improve facility in certain passages", 
        "extending the third valve slide when using the fingerings 1 3 or 1 2 3 further lowers the pitch slightly to improve intonation",

        "vincent van gogh vincent willem van gogh 30 march 1853 29 july 1890 was a dutch post impressionist painter whose work had a far reaching influence on 20th century art for its vivid colors and emotional impact", 
        "he suffered from anxiety and increasingly frequent bouts of mental illness throughout his life and died largely unknown at the age of 37 from a self inflicted gunshot wound", 
        "little appreciated during his lifetime his fame grew in the years after his death", 
        "today he is widely regarded as one of history s greatest painters and an important contributor to the foundations of modern art", 
        "van gogh did not begin painting until his late twenties and most of his best known works were produced during his final two years", 
        "he produced more than 2 000 artworks consisting of around 900 paintings and 1 100 drawings and sketches", 
        "although he was little known during his lifetime his work was a strong influence on the modernist art that followed", 
        "today many of his pieces including his numerous self portraits landscapes portraits and sunflowers are among the world s most recognizable and expensive works of art", 
        "van gogh spent his early adulthood working for a firm of art dealers and traveled between the hague london and paris after which he taught in england", 
        "an early vocational aspiration was to become a pastor and preach the gospel and from 1879 he worked as a missionary in a mining region in belgium", 
        "during this time he began to sketch people from the local community and in 1885 painted his first major work the potato eaters", 
        "his palette at the time consisted mainly of sombre earth tones and showed no sign of the vivid coloration that distinguished his later work", 
        "in march 1886 he moved to paris and discovered the french impressionists", 
        "later he moved to the south of france and was taken by the strong sunlight he found there", 
        "his work grew brighter in color and he developed the unique and highly recognizable style which became fully realized during his stay in arles in 1888", 
        "the extent to which his mental illness affected his painting has been a subject of speculation since his death", 
        "despite a widespread tendency to romanticise his ill health modern critics see an artist deeply frustrated by the inactivity and incoherence brought about by his bouts of sickness", 
        "according to art critic robert hughes van gogh s late works show an artist at the height of his ability completely in control and longing for concision and grace", 
        "the most comprehensive primary source for the understanding of van gogh as a major artist is the collection of letters which were passed between him and his younger brother the art dealer theo van gogh", 
        "they lay the foundation for most of what is known about the thoughts and beliefs of the artist", 
        "theo continually provided his brother with both financial and emotional support", 
        "their lifelong friendship and most of what is known of van gogh s thoughts and theories of art is recorded in the hundreds of letters they exchanged from august 1872 until 1890", 
        "most were written by vincent to theo beginning in the summer of 1872", 
        "more than 600 letters from vincent to theo and 40 from theo to vincent survive today and although many are undated art historians have been able to largely arrange the correspondences chronologically", 
        "problems remain mainly from dating those from the arles period", 
        "yet during that period alone it is known that van gogh wrote 200 letters to friends in dutch french and english", 
        "the period when vincent lived in paris is the most difficult for art historians to examine because he and theo shared accommodation and thus had no need to correspond leaving little or no historical record of the time", 
        "in addition to letters to and from theo other surviving documents include those to van rappard emile bernard van gogh s sister wil and her friend line kruysse", 
        "the letters were first annotated in 1913 by theo s widow johanna van gogh bonger", 
        "in her preface she stated that she published with trepidation because she did not want the drama in the artist s life to overshadow his work",

        "vincent was given the same name as his grandfather and a first brother stillborn exactly one year before", 
        "it has been suggested that being given the same name as his dead elder brother might have had a deep psychological impact on the young artist and that elements of his art such as the portrayal of pairs of male figures can be traced back to this", 
        "the practice of reusing a name in this way was not uncommon", 
        "vincent was a common name in the van gogh family; his grandfather 1789 1874 had received his degree of theology at the university of leiden in 1811",

        "he was increasingly isolated and fervent about religion",

        "he took a position as a supply teacher in a small boarding school overlooking the harbor in ramsgate where he made sketches of the view",

        "at christmas that year he returned home and worked in a bookshop in dordrecht for six months", 
        "however he was not happy in this new position and spent most of his time in the back of the shop either doodling or translating passages from the bible into english french and german", 
        "his roommate at the time a young teacher called gorlitz later recalled that van gogh ate frugally and preferred not to eat meat",

        "in desperation he held his left hand in the flame of a lamp with the words let me see her for as long as i can keep my hand in the flame",

        "van gogh had thought of moving the family from the city but in the end made the break", 
        "it is possible that lack of money had pushed sien back to prostitution the home had become a less happy one and likely van gogh felt family life was irreconcilable with his artistic development", 
        "when he left sien gave her daughter to her mother and baby willem to her brother", 
        "she then moved to delft and later to antwerp",

        "during his two year stay in nuenen he completed numerous drawings and watercolors and nearly 200 oil paintings",

        "by the spring of 1887 they had made peace", 
        "he then moved to asnieres where he became acquainted with signac", 
        "with his friend emile bernard who lived with his parents in asnieres he adopted elements of pointillism whereby many small dots are applied to the canvas to give an optical blend of hues when seen from a distance", 
        "the theory behind this style stresses the value of complementary colors including blue and orange which form vibrant contrasts and enhance each other when juxtaposed", 
        "in november 1887 theo and vincent met and befriended paul gauguin who had just arrived in paris", 
        "towards the end of the year van gogh arranged an exhibition of paintings by himself bernard anquetin and probably toulouse lautrec in the restaurant du chalet on montmartre", 
        "there bernard and anquetin sold their first paintings and van gogh exchanged work with gauguin who soon departed to pont aven", 
        "discussions on art artists and their social situations that started during this exhibition continued and expanded to include visitors to the show like pissarro and his son lucien signac and seurat", 
        "finally in february 1888 feeling worn out from life in paris he left having painted over 200 paintings during his two years in the city",

        "he arrived on 21 february 1888 and took a room at the hotel restaurant carrel which idealistically he had expected to look like one of hokusai 1760 1849 or utamaro s 1753 1806 prints", 
        "he had moved to the town with thoughts of founding a utopian art colony and the danish artist christian mourier petersen became his companion for two months", 
        "however arles appeared exotic and filthy to van gogh", 
        "in a letter he described it as a foreign country; the zouaves the brothels the adorable little arlesiennes going to their first communion the priest in his surplice who looks like a dangerous rhinocerous the people drinking absinthe all seem to me creatures from another world", 
        "alt a narrow bedroom with wooden floor green walls a large bed to the right a 2 straw chairs to the left and a small table a mirror and a shuttered window on the back wall", 
        "hanging over the bed are several small pictures yet he was taken by the local landscape and light", 
        "his works from the period are richly draped in yellow ultramarine and mauve", 
        "his portrayals of the arles landscape are informed by his dutch upbringing; the patchwork of fields and avenues appear flat and lack perspective but excel in their intensity of colour", 
        "the vibrant light in arles excited him and his newfound appreciation is seen in the range and scope of his work from the period", 
        "that march he painted local landscapes using a gridded perspective frame", 
        "three of these paintings were shown at the annual exhibition of the societe des artistes independants", 
        "in april he was visited by the american artist dodge macknight who was living nearby at fontvieille",

        "he had been staying at the hotel restaurant arrel but the rate charged by the hotel was 5 francs a week which he found excessive", 
        "he disputed the price took the case to a local arbitrator and was awarded a twelve franc reduction on his total bill", 
        "he moved from the hotel carrel to the cafe de la gare on 7 may", 
        "he became friends with the proprietors joseph and marie ginoux", 
        "although the yellow house had to be furnished before he could fully move in van gogh was able to utilise it as a studio", 
        "hoping to have a gallery to display his work his major project at this time was a series of paintings which included van gogh s chair 1888 bedroom in arles 1888 the night cafe 1888 the cafe terrace on the place du forum arles at night september 1888 starry night over the rhone 1888 still life vase with twelve sunflowers 1888 all intended to form the decoration for the yellow house", 
        "van gogh wrote about the night cafe i have tried to express the idea that the cafe is a place where one can ruin oneself go mad or commit a crime", 
        "he visited saintes maries de la mer that june where he gave drawing lessons to a zouave second lieutenant paul eugene milliet",

        "upon advice from his friend the station s postal supervisor joseph roulin whose portrait he painted he bought two beds on 8 september and he finally spent the first night in the still sparsely furnished yellow house on 17 september", 
        "when gauguin consented to work and live in arles side by side with van gogh he started to work on the the decoration for the yellow house probably the most ambitious effort he ever undertook", 
        "van gogh did two chair paintings van gogh s chair and gauguin s chair", 
        "after repeated requests gauguin finally arrived in arles on 23 october", 
        "during november the two painted together", 
        "gauguin painted van gogh s portrait the painter of sunflowers portrait of vincent van gogh and uncharacteristically van gogh painted some pictures from memory deferring to gauguin s ideas in this as well as his the red vineyard",

        "however their relationship was deteriorating",

        "on 23 december 1888 frustrated and ill van gogh confronted gauguin with a razor blade", 
        "in panic van gogh left their hotel and fled to a local brothel", 
        "while there he cut off the lower part of his left ear lobe", 
        "he wrapped the severed tissue in newspaper and gave it to a prostitute named rachel asking her to keep this object carefully", 
        "according to doiteau leroy the diagonal cut removed the lobe and probably a little more", 
        "gauguin left arles and never saw van gogh again", 
        "however they continued to correspond and in 1890 gauguin proposed they form an artist studio in antwerp",

        "paul signac visited him in hospital and van gogh was allowed home in his company", 
        "in april he moved into rooms owned by dr rey after floods damaged paintings in his own home", 
        "around this time he wrote sometimes moods of indescribale anguish sometimes moments when the veil of time and fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart for an instant", 
        "two months later he had left arles and entered an asylum in saint remy de provence",

        "the second was to be used as a studio", 
        "during his stay the clinic and its garden became the main subjects of his paintings", 
        "he made several studies of the hospital interiors such as vestibule of the asylum and saint remy september 1889", 
        "some of the work from this time is characterized by swirls including one of his best known paintings the starry night", 
        "he was allowed short supervised walks which gave rise to images of cypresses and olive trees like olive trees with the alpilles in the background 1889 cypresses 1889 cornfield with cypresses 1889 country road in provence by night 1890", 
        "limited access to the world outside the clinic resulted in a shortage of subject matter", 
        "he was left to work on interpretations of other artist s paintings such as millet the sower and noon rest from work after millet as well as variations on his own earlier work", 
        "van gogh was an admirer of millet and compared his copies to a musician s interpreting beethoven", 
        "many of his most compelling works date from this period; his the round of the prisoners 1890 was painted after an engraving by gustave dore 1832 1883 the face of the prisoner in the center of the painting and looking toward the viewer is van gogh", 
        "that september he produced a further two versions of bedroom in arles and in february 1890 painted four portraits of l arlesienne madame ginoux based on a charcoal sketch gauguin had produced when madame ginoux sat for both artists at the beginning of november 1888",

        "at the opening dinner les xx member henry de groux insulted van gogh s works",

        "later when van gogh s exhibit was on display with the artistes independants in paris monet said that his work was the best in the show", 
        "in february 1890 following the birth of his nephew vincent willem he wrote in a letter to his mother that with the new addition to the family he started right away to make a picture for him to hang in their bedroom big branches of white almond blossom against a blue sky",

        "dr gachet was recommended to van gogh by camille pissarro 1830 1903 ; gachet had previously treated several artists and was an amateur artist himself", 
        "van gogh s first impression was that gachet was sicker than i am i think or shall we say just as much", 
        "in june 1890 he painted portrait of dr gachet and completed two portraits of gachet in oils as well as a third his only etching", 
        "in all three the emphasis is on gachet s melancholic disposition", 
        "in his last weeks at saint remy van gogh s thoughts had been returning to his memories of the north and several of the approximately 70 oils he painted during his 70 days in auvers sur oise such as the church at auvers are reminiscent of northern scenes", 
        "wheat field with crows july 1890 is an example of the unusual double square canvas which he developed in the last weeks of his life", 
        "in its turbulent intensity it is among his most haunting and elemental works", 
        "it is often mistakenly stated to be his last work but van gogh scholar jan hulsker lists seven paintings which postdate it", 
        "barbizon painter charles daubigny moved to auvers in 1861 and this in turn drew other artists there including camille corot honore daumier and in 1890 vincent van gogh", 
        "in july 1890 van gogh completed two paintings of daubigny s garden and one of these is most likely to be his final work", 
        "there are also paintings which show evidence of being unfinished such as thatched cottages by a hill", 
        "recently acquitted from hospital van gogh suffered a severe setback in december 1889", 
        "although he had been troubled by mental illness throughout his life the episodes became more pronounced during the last few years of his life", 
        "in some of these periods he chose to not or was unable to paint a factor which added to the mounting frustrations of an artist at the peak of his ability", 
        "his depression gradually deepened", 
        "on 27 july 1890 aged 37 he walked into a field and shot himself in the chest with a revolver", 
        "he survived the impact but not realizing that his injuries were to be fatal he walked back to the ravoux inn", 
        "he died there two days later",

        "he was admitted to hospital and weak and unable to come to terms with vincent s absence he died six months later on 25 january at utrecht", 
        "in 1914 theo s body was exhumed and re buried with his brother at auvers sur oise", 
        "while most of vincent s late paintings are somber they are essentially optimistic and reflect a desire to return to lucid mental health", 
        "however the paintings completed in the days before his suicide are severely dark", 
        "his at eternity s gate a portrayal of an old man holding his head in his hands is particularly bleak", 
        "the work serves as a compelling and poignant expression of the artist s state of mind in his final days", 
        "there has been much debate over the years as to the source of van gogh s illness and its effect on his work", 
        "over 150 psychiatrists have attempted to label its root and some 30 different diagnoses have been suggested", 
        "diagnoses that have been put forward include schizophrenia bipolar disorder syphilis poisoning from swallowed paints temporal lobe epilepsy and acute intermittent porphyria", 
        "any of these could have been the culprit and been aggravated by malnutrition overwork insomnia and a fondness for alcohol especially absinthe", 
        "van gogh drew and painted with watercolors while at school; few of these works survive and authorship is challenged on some of those that do", 
        "when he committed to art as an adult he began at an elementary level by copying the cours de dessin edited by charles bargue and published by goupil cie", 
        "within his first two years he had began to seek commissions", 
        "in spring 1882 his uncle cornelis marinus owner of a renowned gallery of contemporary art in amsterdam asked him for drawings of the hague", 
        "van gogh s work did not prove equal to his uncle s expectations", 
        "marinus offered a second commission this time specifying the subject matter in detail but was once again disappointed with the result", 
        "nevertheless van gogh persevered", 
        "he improved the lighting of his atelier studio by installing variable shutters and experimented with a variety of drawing materials", 
        "for more than a year he worked on single figures highly elaborated studies in black and white which at the time gained him only criticism", 
        "today they are recogonised as his first masterpieces", 
        "early in 1883 he undertook work on multi figure compositions which he based on the drawings", 
        "he had some of them photographed but when his brother remarked that they lacked liveliness and freshness van gogh destroyed them and turned to oil painting", 
        "by autumn 1882 theo had enabled him to do his first paintings but the amount theo could supply was soon spent", 
        "then in spring 1883 van gogh turned to renowned hague school artists like weissenbruch and blommers and received technical support from them as well as from painters like de bock and van der weele both hague school artists of the second generation", 
        "when he moved to nuenen after the intermezzo in drenthe he began a number of large size paintings but destroyed most", 
        "the potato eaters and its companion pieces the old tower on the nuenen cemetery and the cottage are the only to have survived", 
        "following a visit to the rijksmuseum van gogh was aware that many of his faults were due to lack of technical experience",

        "in the sky there is a bright star with a large intense yellow halo around it more or less acquainted with impressionist and neo impressionist techniques and theories van gogh went to arles to develop these new possibilities", 
        "but within a short time older ideas on art and work reappeared ideas such as series on related or contrasting subject matter which would reflect the purposes of art", 
        "as his work progressed he painted a great many self portraits", 
        "already in 1884 in nuenen he had worked on a series that was to decorate the dining room of a friend in eindhoven", 
        "similarly in arles in spring 1888 he arranged his flowering orchards into triptychs began a series of figures that found its end in the roulin family and finally when gauguin had consented to work and live in arles side by side with van gogh he started to work on the the decoration for the yellow house which was by some accounts the most ambitious effort he ever undertook", 
        "most of his later work is elaborating or revising its fundamental settings", 
        "in the spring of 1889 he painted another smaller group of orchards", 
        "in an april letter to theo he said i have 6 studies of spring two of them large orchards", 
        "there is little time because these effects are so short lived", 
        "the art historian albert boime was the first to show that van gogh even in seemingly phantastical compositions like starry night relied on reality", 
        "the white house at night shows a house at twilight with a prominent star with a yellow halo in the sky", 
        "astronomers at southwest texas state university in san marcos calculated that the star is venus which was bright in the evening sky in june 1890 when van gogh is believed to have painted the picture", 
        "the paintings from the saint remy period are often characterized by swirls and spirals", 
        "the patterns of luminosity in these images have been shown to conform to kolmogorov s statistical model of turbulence", 
        "alt standing within the lobby of a hospital looking towards an open double doorway to the garden and fountain outside in the distance", 
        "a self taught artist with little training van gogh s painting and drawing techniques are all but academic", 
        "recent research has shown that works commonly known as oil paintings or drawings would better be described as mixed media", 
        "the langlois bridge at arles shows highly elaborate under drawing in pen and ink while several works from saint remy and auvers hitherto considered to be drawings or watercolors such as vestibule of the asylum saint remy september 1889 turned out to be painted in diluted oil and with a brush", 
        "radiographical examination has shown that van gogh re used older canvases more extensively than previously assumed whether he really overpainted more than a third of his output as presumed recently must be verified by further investigations", 
        "in 2008 a team from delft university of technology and the university of antwerp used advanced x ray techniques to create a clear image of a woman s face previously painted underneath the work patch of grass", 
        "one of the most popular and widely known series of van gogh s paintings are his cypresses", 
        "during the summer of 1889 at sister wil s request he made several smaller versions of wheat field with cypresses", 
        "the works are characterised by swirls and densely painted impasto and produced one of his best known paintings the starry night", 
        "others works from the series have similar stylistic elements including olive trees with the alpilles in the background 1889 cypresses 1889 wheat field with cypresses 1889 van gogh made several versions of this painting that year road with cypress and star 1890 and starry night over the rhone 1888", 
        "these have become synonymous with van gogh s work through their stylistic uniqueness", 
        "according to art historian ronald pickvance road with cypress and star 1890 is a painting compositionally as unreal and artificial as the starry night", 
        "pickvance goes on to say the painting road with cypress and star represents an exalted experience of reality a conflation of north and south what both van gogh and gauguin referred to as an abstraction", 
        "referring to olive trees with the alpilles in the background on or around june 18 1889 in a letter to theo he wrote at last i have a landscape with olives and also a new study of a starry night", 
        "hoping to also have a gallery for his work his major project at this time was a series of paintings including still life vase with twelve sunflowers 1888 and starry night over the rhone 1888 that all intended to form the decoration of the yellow house", 
        "the series of flowering orchards sometimes referred to as the orchards in blossom paintings were among the first group of work that van gogh completed after his arrival in arles provence in february 1888", 
        "the 14 paintings in this group are optimistic joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning springtime", 
        "they are delicately sensitive silent quiet and unpopulated", 
        "vincent wrote to theo on april 21 1888 and said he had 10 orchards and one big painting of a cherry tree which i ve spoiled", 
        "the following spring he painted another smaller group of orchards including view of arles flowering orchards", 
        "van gogh was taken by the landscape and vegetation of the south of france and often visited the farm gardens near arles", 
        "because of the vivid light supplied by the mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened", 
        "from his arrival he was interested it capturing the effect of the seasons on the surrounding landscape and plant life", 
        "van gogh painted several versions of landscapes with flowers as seen in view of arles with irises and paintings of flowers such as irises sunflowers lilacs roses oleanders and other flowers", 
        "some of the paintings of flowers reflect his interests in the language of color and also in japanese ukiyo e woodblock prints", 
        "he completed two series of sunflowers the first while he was in paris in 1887 and the later during his stay in arles the following year", 
        "the first set show the flowers set in ground", 
        "in the second set they are dying in vases", 
        "however the 1888 paintings were created during a rare period of optimism for the artist", 
        "he intended them to decorate a bedroom where paul gauguin was supposed to stay in arles that august when the two would create the community of artists van gogh had long hoped for", 
        "the flowers are rendered with thick brushstrokes impasto and heavy layers of paint", 
        "in an august 1888 letter to theo he wrote i am hard at it painting with the enthusiasm of a marseillais eating bouillabaisse which won t surprise you when you know that what i m at is the painting of some sunflowers", 
        "if i carry out this idea there will be a dozen panels", 
        "so the whole thing will be a symphony in blue and yellow", 
        "i am working at it every morning from sunrise on for the flowers fade so quickly", 
        "i am now on the fourth picture of sunflowers", 
        "this fourth one is a bunch of 14 flowers it gives a singular effect", 
        "the series is perhaps his best known and most widely reproduced", 
        "in recent years there has been debate regarding the authenticity of one of the paintings and it has been suggested that this version may have been the work of emile schuffenecker or of paul gauguin", 
        "most experts however conclude that the work is genuine", 
        "alt a golden hued field with streaks of green and a blue sky and a flock of black birds in the background van gogh made several painting excursions during visits to the landscape around arles", 
        "he drew a number of paintings featuring harvests wheat fields and other rural landmarks of the area including the old mill 1888 ; a good example of a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields beyond", 
        "it was one of seven canvases sent to pont aven on october 4 1888 as exchange of work with paul gauguin emile bernard charles laval and others", 
        "at various times in his life van gogh painted the view from his window at the hague antwerp paris", 
        "these works culminated in the wheat field series which depicted the view he could see from his adjoining cells in the asylum at saint remy", 
        "writing in july 1890 van gogh said that he had become absorbed in the immense plain against the hills boundless as the sea delicate yellow", 
        "he had become captivated by the fields in may when the wheat was young and green", 
        "the weather worsened in july and he wrote to theo of vast fields of wheat under troubled skies adding that he did not need to go out of my way to try and express sadness and extreme loneliness", 
        "by august he had painted the crops both young and mature and during both dark and bright weather", 
        "a depiction of the golden wheat in bright sunlight was to be his final painting along with his usual easel and paints he had carried a pistol with him that day", 
        "alt man wearing a straw hat carrying a canvas and paintbox walking to the left down a tree lined leaf strewn country road since his first exhibits in the late 1880s van gogh s fame grew steadily among colleagues art critics dealers and collectors", 
        "after his death memorial exhibitions were mounted in brussels paris the hague and antwerp", 
        "in the early 20th century the exhibitions were followed by vast retrospectives in paris 1901 and 1905 amsterdam 1905 cologne 1912 new york city 1913 and berlin 1914", 
        "these prompted a noticeable impact over later generations of artists", 
        "in his final letter to theo vincent admitted that as he did not have any children he viewed his paintings as his progeny", 
        "reflecting on this the historian simon schama concluded that he did have a child of course expressionism and many many heirs", 
        "schama mentioned a wide number of artists who have adapted elements of van gogh s style including willem de kooning howard hodgkin and jackson pollock", 
        "the french fauves including henri matisse extended both his use of color and freedom in applying it as did german expressionists in the die brucke group", 
        "abstract expressionism of the 1940s and 1950s is seen as in part inspired from van gogh s broad gestural brush strokes", 
        "in 1957 francis bacon 1909 1992 based a series of paintings on reproductions of van gogh s the painter on the road to tarascon the original of which was destroyed during world war ii", 
        "bacon was inspired by not only an image he described as haunting but also van gogh himself whom bacon regarded as an alienated outsider a position with resonated with bacon", 
        "the irish artist further identified with van gogh s theories of art and quoted lines written in a letter to theo r eal painters do not paint things as they arethey paint them as they themselves feel them to be",

        "violin the violin is a bowed string instrument with four strings usually tuned in perfect fifths", 
        "it is the smallest and highest pitched member of the violin family of string instruments which also includes the viola and cello", 
        "a violin is sometimes informally called a fiddle regardless of the type of music played on it", 
        "the word violin comes from the middle latin word vitula meaning stringed instrument ; this word is also believed to be the source of the germanic fiddle", 
        "the violin while it has ancient origins acquired most of its modern characteristics in 16th century italy with some further modifications occurring in the 18th century", 
        "violinists and collectors particularly prize the instruments made by the stradivari guarneri and amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in cremona", 
        "a person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or simply a violin maker", 
        "the parts of a violin are usually made from different types of wood although electric violins may not be made of wood at all since their sound may not be dependent on specific acoustic characteristics of the instrument s construction and it is generally strung with gut or steel strings", 
        "someone who plays the violin is called a violinist or a fiddler", 
        "he or she produces sound from a violin by either drawing a bow normally held in the right hand across one or more strings which may be stopped by the fingers of the other hand to produce a full range of pitches plucking the strings with either hand or a variety of other techniques", 
        "the violin is played by musicians in a wide variety of musical genres including classical jazz folk and traditional and rock and roll", 
        "the earliest stringed instruments were mostly plucked e g", 
        "the greek lyre", 
        "bowed instruments may have originated in the equestrian cultures of central asia an example being the mongolian instrument morin huur turkic and mongolian horsemen from inner asia were probably the world s earliest fiddlers", 
        "their two stringed upright fiddles were strung with horsehair strings played with horsehair bows and often feature a carved horse s head at the end of the neck", 
        "the violins violas and cellos we play today and whose bows are still strung with horsehair are a legacy of the nomads", 
        "it is believed that these instruments eventually spread to china india and the middle east where they developed into instruments such as the erhu in china the rebab in the middle east and the esraj in india", 
        "the violin in its present form emerged in early 16th century in northern italy where the port towns of venice and genoa maintained extensive ties to central asia through the trade routes of the silk road", 
        "the modern european violin evolved from various bowed stringed instruments which were brought from the middle east", 
        "most likely the first makers of violins borrowed from three types of current instruments the rebec in use since the 10th century itself derived from the arabic rebab the renaissance fiddle and the lira da braccio", 
        "one of the earliest explicit descriptions of the instrument including its tuning was in the epitome musical by jambe de fer published in lyon in 1556", 
        "by this time the violin had already begun to spread throughout europe", 
        "the oldest documented violin to have four strings like the modern violin is supposed to have been constructed in 1555 by andrea amati but the date is doubtuful", 
        "other violins documented significantly earlier only had three strings", 
        "the violin immediately became very popular both among street musicians and the nobility illustrated by the fact that the french king charles ix ordered amati to construct 24 violins for him in 1560", 
        "the oldest surviving violin dated inside is from this set and is known as the charles ix made in cremona c 1560", 
        "the messiah or le messie also known as the salabue made by antonio stradivari in 1716 remains pristine never having been used",

        "the majority of old instruments have undergone these modifications and hence are in a significantly different state than when they left the hands of their makers doubtless with differences in sound and response", 
        "but these instruments in their present condition set the standard for perfection in violin craftsmanship and sound and violin makers all over the world try to come as close to this ideal as possible", 
        "to this day instruments from the golden age of violin making especially those made by stradivari and guarneri del gesu are the most sought after instruments by both collectors and performers", 
        "the construction of a violin a violin typically consists of a spruce top the soundboard also known as the top plate table or belly maple ribs and back two endblocks a neck a bridge a soundpost four strings and various fittings optionally including a chinrest which may attach directly over or to the left of the tailpiece", 
        "a distinctive feature of a violin body is its hourglass shape and the arching of its top and back", 
        "the hourglass shape comprises two upper bouts two lower bouts and two concave c bouts at the waist providing clearance for the bow", 
        "the voice of a violin depends on its shape the wood it is made from the graduation the thickness profile of both the top and back and the varnish which coats its outside surface",

        "beginners sometimes rely on tapes placed on the fingerboard for proper left hand finger placement but usually abandon the tapes quickly as they advance", 
        "another commonly used marking technique uses dots of white out on the fingerboard which wear off in a few weeks of regular practice", 
        "this practice unfortunately is used sometimes in lieu of adequate ear training guiding the placement of fingers by eye and not by ear", 
        "especially in the early stages of learning to play the so called ringing tones are useful",

        "first position where most beginners start although some methods start in third position is the most commonly used position in string music", 
        "the lowest note available in this position in standard tuning is an open g; the highest note in first position is played with the fourth finger on the e string sounding a b or reaching up a half step also known as the extended fourth finger to the c two octaves above middle c moving the hand up the neck so the first finger takes the place of the second finger brings the player into second position", 
        "letting the first finger take the first position place of the third finger brings the player to third position and so on", 
        "the upper limit of the violin s range is largely determined by the skill of the player who may easily play more than two octaves on a single string and four octaves on the instrument as a whole although when a violinist has progressed to the point of being able to use the entire range of the instrument references to particular positions become less common", 
        "position names are mostly used for the lower positions and in method books; for this reason it is uncommon to hear references to anything higher than fifth position", 
        "the lowest position on a violin is half position where the first finger is a half step away from the nut", 
        "this position is less frequently used", 
        "the highest position practically speaking is 15 th position", 
        "the same note will sound substantially different depending on what string is used to play it", 
        "sometimes the composer or arranger will specify the string to be used in order to achieve the desired tone quality; this is indicated in the music by the marking for example sul g meaning to play on the g string", 
        "for example playing very high up on the lower strings gives a distinctive quality to the sound", 
        "otherwise moving into different positions is usually done for ease of playing", 
        "bowing or plucking an open string that is a string played without any finger stopping it gives a different sound from a stopped string since the string vibrates more freely at the nut than under a finger", 
        "other than the low g which can be played in no other way open strings are generally avoided in some styles of classical playing", 
        "this is because they have a somewhat harsher sound especially open e and it is not possible to directly use vibrato on an open string", 
        "however this can be partially compensated by applying vibrato on a note that is an octave higher than the open string", 
        "in some cases playing an open string is called for by the composer and explicitly marked in the music for special effect decided upon by the musician for artistic reasons common in earlier works such as bach or played in a fast passage where they usually cannot be distinguished", 
        "playing an open string simultaneously with a stopped note on an adjacent string produces a bagpipe like drone often used by composers in imitation of folk music", 
        "sometimes the two notes are identical for instance playing a fingered a on the d string against the open a string giving a ringing sort of fiddling sound", 
        "playing an open string simultaneously with an identical stopped note can also be called for when more volume is required especially in orchestral playing", 
        "double stopping is when two separate strings are stopped by the fingers and bowed simultaneously producing a chord", 
        "sometimes moving to a higher position is necessary for the left hand to be able to reach both notes at once", 
        "sounding an open string alongside a fingered note is another way to get a partial chord", 
        "while sometimes also called a double stop it is more properly called a drone as the drone note may be sustained for a passage of different notes played on the adjacent string", 
        "three or four notes can also be played at one time triple and quadruple stops respectively and according to the style of music the notes might all be played simultaneously or might be played as two successive double stops favoring the higher notes", 
        "playing the notes simultaneously is done by applying more pressure to the bow and or bowing closer to the fingerboard", 
        "vibrato is a technique of the left hand and arm in which the pitch of a note varies in a pulsating rhythm", 
        "while various parts of the hand or arm may be involved in the motion the end result is a movement of the fingertip bringing about a slight change in vibrating string length", 
        "violinists oscillate backwards or lower in pitch from the actual note when using vibrato since perception favors the highest pitch in a varying sound", 
        "vibrato does little if anything to disguise an out of tune note in other words vibrato is a poor substitute for good intonation", 
        "still scales and other exercises meant to work on intonation are typically played without vibrato to make the work easier and more effective", 
        "music students are taught that unless otherwise marked in music vibrato is assumed or even mandatory", 
        "this can be an obstacle to a classically trained violinist wishing to play in a style that uses little or no vibrato at all such as baroque music played in period style and many traditional fiddling styles", 
        "vibrato can be produced by a proper combination of finger wrist and arm motions", 
        "one method called hand vibrato involves rocking the hand back at the wrist to achieve oscillation while another method arm vibrato modulates the pitch by rocking at the elbow", 
        "a combination of these techniques allows a player to produce a large variety of tonal effects", 
        "the when and what for of violin vibrato are artistic matters of style and taste", 
        "in acoustical terms the interest that vibrato adds to the sound has to do with the way that the overtone mix or tone color or timbre and the directional pattern of sound projection change with changes in pitch", 
        "by pointing the sound at different parts of the room in a rhythmic way vibrato adds a shimmer or liveliness to the sound of a well made violin", 
        "see schleske and weinreich", 
        "vibrato can also be used for a fast trill", 
        "a trill initiated from just hammering the finger up and down on the fingerboard will create a harsher quality than with a vibrato trill", 
        "for example if trilling on the first finger the second finger is placed very slightly off the string and vibrato is implemented", 
        "the second finger will lightly touch the string above the first finger causing the pitch to change", 
        "this has a softer quality and many think it is nicer sounding than a hammered trill", 
        "note this trill technique only works well for semi tonal trills it is far more difficult to vibrato trill for an interval of a tone or more", 
        "lightly touching the string with a fingertip at a harmonic node creates harmonics", 
        "instead of the normal tone a higher pitched note sounds each node is at an integer division of the string for example half way or one third along the length of the string", 
        "a responsive instrument will sound numerous possible harmonic nodes along the length of the string", 
        "harmonics are marked in music either with a little circle above the note that determines the pitch of the harmonic or by diamond shaped note heads", 
        "there are two types of harmonics natural harmonics and artificial harmonics also known as false harmonics", 
        "natural harmonics are played on an open string", 
        "the pitch of the open string is called the fundamental frequency", 
        "harmonics are also called overtones", 
        "they occur at whole number multiples of the fundamental which is called the first harmonic", 
        "the second harmonic is the first overtone the third harmonic is the second overtone and so on", 
        "the second harmonic is in the middle of the string and sounds an octave higher than the string s pitch", 
        "the third harmonic breaks the string into thirds and sounds an octave and a fifth above the fundamental and the fourth harmonic breaks the string into quarters sounding two octaves above the first", 
        "the sound of the second harmonic is the clearest of them all because it is a common node with all the succeeding even numbered harmonics 4th 6th etc", 
        "the third and succeeding odd numbered harmonics are harder to play because they break the string into an odd number of vibrating parts and do not share as many nodes with other harmonics", 
        "artificial harmonics are more difficult to produce than natural harmonics as they involve both stopping the string and playing a harmonic on the stopped note", 
        "using the octave frame the normal distance between the first and fourth fingers in any given position with the fourth finger just touching the string a fourth higher than the stopped note produces the fourth harmonic two octaves above the stopped note", 
        "finger placement and pressure as well as bow speed pressure and sounding point are all essential in getting the desired harmonic to sound", 
        "and to add to the challenge in passages with different notes played as false harmonics the distance between stopping finger and harmonic finger must constantly change since the spacing between notes changes along the length of the string", 
        "the harmonic finger can also touch at a major third above the pressed note the fifth harmonic or a fifth higher a third harmonic", 
        "these harmonics are less commonly used; in the case of the major third both the stopped note and touched note must be played slightly sharp otherwise the harmonic does not speak as readily", 
        "in the case of the fifth the stretch is greater than is comfortable for many violinists", 
        "in the general repertoire fractions smaller than a sixth are not used", 
        "however divisions up to an eighth are sometimes used and given a good instrument and a skilled player divisions as small as a twelfth are possible", 
        "there are a few books dedicated solely to the study of violin harmonics", 
        "two comprehensive works are henryk heller s seven volume theory of harmonics published by simrock in 1928 and michelangelo abbado s five volume tecnica dei suoni armonici published by ricordi in 1934 elaborate passages in artificial harmonics can be found in virtuoso violin literature especially of the 19th and early 20th centuries", 
        "two notable examples of this are an entire section of vittorio monti s csardas and a passage towards the middle of the third movement of pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky s violin concerto", 
        "the right arm hand and bow are responsible for tone quality rhythm dynamics articulation and most but not all changes in timbre", 
        "the most essential part of bowing technique is the bow grip", 
        "it is usually with the thumb bent in the small area between the frog and the winding of the bow", 
        "the other fingers are spread somewhat evenly across the top part of the bow", 
        "the violin produces louder notes with greater bow speed or more weight on the string", 
        "the two methods are not equivalent because they produce different timbres; pressing down on the string tends to produce a harsher more intense sound", 
        "the sounding point where the bow intersects the string also influences timbre", 
        "playing close to the bridge sul ponticello gives a more intense sound than usual emphasizing the higher harmonics; and playing with the bow over the end of the fingerboard sul tasto makes for a delicate ethereal sound emphasizing the fundamental frequency", 
        "dr suzuki referred to the sounding point as the kreisler highway ; one may think of different sounding points as lanes in the highway", 
        "various methods of attack with the bow produce different articulations", 
        "there are many bowing techniques that allow for every range of playing style and many teachers players and orchestras spend a lot of time developing techniques and creating a unified technique within the group", 
        "these techniques include legato style bowing colle ricochet sautille martele spiccato and staccato", 
        "a note marked pizz", 
        "abbreviation for pizzicato in the written music is to be played by plucking the string with a finger of the right hand rather than by bowing", 
        "the index finger is most commonly used here", 
        "sometimes in virtuoso solo music where the bow hand is occupied or for show off effect left hand pizzicato will be indicated by a plus sign below or above the note", 
        "in left hand pizzicato two fingers are put on the string; one usually the index or middle finger is put on the correct note and the other usually the ring finger or little finger is put above the note", 
        "the higher finger then plucks the string while the lower one stays on thus producing the correct pitch", 
        "by increasing the force of the pluck one can increase the volume of the note that the string produces", 
        "a marking of col legno italian for with the wood in the written music calls for striking the string s with the stick of the bow rather than by drawing the hair of the bow across the strings", 
        "this bowing technique is somewhat rarely used and results in a muted percussive sound", 
        "the eerie quality of a violin section playing col legno is exploited in some symphonic pieces notably the witches dance of the last movement of berlioz s symphonie fantastique",

        "mars from gustav holst s the planets uses col legno to play a repeated rhythm in 5 4 time signature",

        "very rapid repetition typically of a single note but occasionally of multiple notes usually played at the tip of the bow", 
        "attaching a small metal rubber or wooden device called a mute to the bridge of the violin gives a softer more mellow tone with fewer audible overtones; the sound of an entire orchestral string section playing with mutes has a hushed quality", 
        "the conventional italian markings for mute usage are con sord or con sordina with mute and senza sord without mute or via sord mute out", 
        "larger metal rubber or wooden mutes are available known as practice mutes or hotel mutes", 
        "such mutes are generally not used in performance but are used to deaden the sound of the violin in practice areas such as hotel rooms", 
        "some composers have used practice mutes for special effect for example at the end of luciano berio s sequenza viii for solo violin", 
        "since the baroque era the violin has been one of the most important of all instruments in classical music for several reasons", 
        "the tone of the violin stands out above other instruments making it appropriate for playing a melody line",

        "violins make up a large part of an orchestra and are usually divided into two sections known as the first and second violins", 
        "composers often assign the melody to the first violins while second violins play harmony accompaniment patterns or the melody an octave lower than the first violins", 
        "a string quartet similarly has parts for first and second violins as well as a viola part and a bass instrument such as the cello or rarely the double bass", 
        "string instruments have the ability to play in any pitch which in the hands of great players leads to wonderful range of harmonic colouring making it possible for the instruments to be very expressive",
